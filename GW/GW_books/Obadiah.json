      "1": "This is the vision of Obadiah.\nThis is what the Almighty Lord says about Edom:\nWe have heard a message from the Lord.\nA messenger was sent among the nations to say,\n“Get ready! Let’s go to war against Edom.”",
      "2": "“Edom, I will make you the smallest of nations.\nOthers will despise you.",
      "3": "Your arrogance has deceived you.\nYou live on rocky cliffs.\nYou make your home up high.\nYou say to yourself,\n‘No one can bring me down to earth.’",
      "4": "Even though you fly high like an eagle\nand build your nest among the stars,\nI will bring you down from there,” declares the Lord.",
      "5": "“If thieves or looters come to you during the night,\nwon’t they steal only until they’ve had enough?\nYou will be ruined!\nIf people come to pick your grapes,\nwon’t they leave a few grapes behind?",
      "6": "But you, Esau, will lose everything.\nEven your hidden treasures will be looted.",
      "7": "All your allies will force you to leave your land.\nThe people who are at peace with you will deceive you.\nThose who eat food with you will set traps for you,\nand you won’t even know about it.",
      "8": "“On that day I will destroy the wise people in Edom\nand take wisdom away from Esau’s mountain,” declares the Lord.",
      "9": "“Teman, your warriors will be terrified.\nEveryone on Esau’s mountain will be slaughtered.",
      "10": "“Because of the violence you did to Jacob, your relative,\nyou will be covered with shame.\nYou will be destroyed forever.",
      "11": "While you stood there doing nothing,\nstrangers carried off Jacob’s wealth.\nForeigners entered his gates and threw dice for Jerusalem.\nYou acted like one of them.",
      "12": "Don’t gloat over your relative’s misfortune\nor be happy when the people of Judah are destroyed.\nDon’t brag so much when they’re in distress.",
      "13": "Don’t march through the gates of my people when disaster strikes\nor gloat over their misery when disaster strikes.\nDon’t take their wealth when disaster strikes.",
      "14": "Don’t stand at the crossroads to kill their refugees.\nDon’t hand over their survivors when they’re in distress.",
      "15": "“The day of the Lord is near for all nations.\nEdom, you will be treated as you have treated others.\nYou will get back what you have given.",
      "16": "As you, Israel, drank on my holy mountain,\nso all nations will drink in turn.\nThey will drink and guzzle down everything in it.\nThey will be like those who have never existed.",
      "17": "“But refugees will live on Mount Zion.\nIt will be holy.\nThe descendants of Jacob will get back their possessions.",
      "18": "The descendants of Jacob will be like a fire.\nThe descendants of Joseph will be like a flame.\nBut the descendants of Esau will be like straw.\nThey will be burned and destroyed.\nThere will be no one left among the descendants of Esau.”\nThe Lord has spoken.",
      "19": "“People from the Negev will take possession of Esau’s mountain.\nPeople from the foothills will take possession of Philistia.\nThey will take possession of the lands of Ephraim and Samaria,\nand the descendants of Benjamin will take possession of Gilead.",
      "20": "Exiles from Israel will take possession of Canaan.\nThey will possess land as far as Zarephath.\nExiles from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad\nwill take possession of the cities in the Negev.",
      "21": "Those who are victorious will come from Mount Zion\nto rule Esau’s mountain.\nThe kingdom will belong to the Lord.”"
