      "11": "“This is what the Lord of Armies says: Ask the priests for a decision.",
      "12": "Suppose a person carries meat set aside for a holy purpose and he folds it up in his clothes. If his clothes touch bread, boiled food, wine, oil, or any kind of food, does that make the food holy?”\nThe priests answered, “No.”",
      "13": "Haggai asked, “Suppose a person becomes unclean  by touching a corpse. If he touches any of these things, does that make them unclean?”\nThe priests answered, “That makes them unclean.”",
      "14": "Then Haggai answered, “In the same way, I have decided that these people are unclean, and so is this nation, declares the Lord. So is everything they do. Whatever offering they bring is unclean.",
