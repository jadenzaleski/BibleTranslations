      "1": "The divine revelation that the prophet Habakkuk saw.",
      "2": "How long, O Lord, am I to cry for help,\nbut you will not listen?\nI cry out to you, “There’s violence!”\nyet you will not come to the rescue.",
      "3": "Why do you make me see wrongdoing?\nAnd why do you watch wickedness?\nDestruction and violence are in front of me.\nQuarrels and disputes arise.",
      "4": "That is why your teaching is numbed,\nand justice is never carried out.\nWicked people surround righteous people\nso that when justice is carried out, it’s perverted.",
      "5": "Look among the nations and watch.\nBe amazed and astonished.\nI am going to do something in your days\nthat you would not believe even if it were reported to you.",
      "6": "I am going to send the Babylonians,\nthat fierce and reckless nation.\nThey will march throughout the earth\nto take possession of lands that don’t belong to them.",
      "7": "They will be terrifying and fearsome.\nThey will carry out their own kind of justice and honor.",
      "8": "Their horses will be faster than leopards\nand quicker than wolves in the evening.\nTheir riders will gallop along proudly.\nTheir riders will come from far away.\nThey will fly like an eagle that swoops down for its prey.",
      "9": "They will all come for violence.\nEvery face will be directed forward.\nThey will gather prisoners like sand.",
      "10": "They will make fun of kings and treat rulers as a joke.\nThey will laugh at every fortified city\nand build a dirt ramp to capture it.",
      "11": "They will move quickly and pass through like the wind.\nSo they will be guilty,\nbecause their own strength is their god.",
      "12": "Didn’t you exist before time began, O Lord, my God, my Holy One?\nWe will not die!\nO Lord, you have appointed the Babylonians to bring judgment.\nO Rock, you have destined them to correct us.",
      "13": "Your eyes are too pure to look at evil.\nYou can’t watch wickedness.\nWhy do you keep watching treacherous people?\nWhy are you silent when wicked people swallow those\nwho are more righteous than they are?",
      "14": "You make all people like the fish in the sea,\nlike schools of sea life that have no ruler.",
      "15": "The Babylonians pull them all up with fishhooks,\ndrag them away in nets,\nand gather them in dragnets.\nSo they rejoice and are happy.",
      "16": "That is why they sacrifice to their nets and burn incense to their dragnets.\nThey are rich and well fed because of them.",
      "17": "Will they keep on emptying their nets\nand always kill nations without mercy?"

      "1": "I will stand at my guard post.\nI will station myself on the wall.\nI will watch to see what he will say to me\nand what answer I will get to my complaint.",
      "2": "Then the Lord answered me,\n“Write the vision.\nMake it clear on tablets\nso that anyone can read it quickly.",
      "3": "The vision will still happen at the appointed time.\nIt hurries toward its goal.\nIt won’t be a lie.\nIf it’s delayed, wait for it.\nIt will certainly happen.\nIt won’t be late.",
      "4": "“Look at the proud person. He is not right in himself.\nBut the righteous person will live because of his faithfulness.",
      "5": "Also because wine is treacherous\nhe is arrogant and never rests.\nHe has a large appetite like the grave.\nHe is like death—never satisfied.\nHe gathers all the nations to himself.\nHe collects all the people to himself.",
      "6": "Won’t all of them ridicule him,\ndirecting clever sayings and riddles at him, like: \n“ ‘How horrible it will be for the one who makes himself rich\nwith what is not his own\nand makes himself wealthy on loans.\nHow long will this go on?’",
      "7": "Won’t your creditors suddenly rise up\nand those who are going to shake you wake up?\nThen you will become their prize.",
      "8": "You have looted many nations.\nAll the rest of the people will loot you\nbecause of the slaughter and violence done\nto lands, cities, and all their inhabitants.",
      "9": "“ ‘How horrible it will be for the one who uses violence\nto get things for his own household\nin order to set his nest up high\nand save himself from disaster.’",
      "10": "You have planned disgrace for your household\nby cutting off many people and forfeiting your own life.",
      "11": "A stone in the wall will cry out.\nA beam in the roof will answer it.",
      "12": "“ ‘How horrible it will be for the one who builds a city by slaughter\nand founds a town by crime.’",
      "13": "Isn’t it from the Lord of Armies\nthat people grow tired only to feed the flames\nand nations exhaust themselves for nothing?",
      "14": "But the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord’s glory\nlike the water covers the sea.",
      "15": "“ ‘How horrible it will be for the one who makes his neighbor drink\nfrom the bowl of God’s rage,\nmaking him drunk in order to stare at his nakedness.’",
      "16": "You are filled with disgrace rather than glory.\nDrink! Yes you! And expose yourself as godless.\nThe cup in the Lord’s right hand will come around to you,\nand disgrace will cover your glory.",
      "17": "The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,\nand the destruction done to the animals will terrify you\nbecause of the slaughter and violence done\nto lands, cities, and all their inhabitants.",
      "18": "“What benefit is there in a carved idol\nwhen its maker has carved it?\nWhat benefit is there in a molded statue, a teacher of lies,\nwhen its maker has molded it?\nThe one who formed it trusts himself\nto make worthless idols that cannot speak.",
      "19": "‘How horrible it will be for the one\nwho says to a piece of wood, “Wake up!”\nand to a stone that cannot talk, “Get up!” ’\nCan that thing teach anyone?\nJust look at it!\nIt’s covered with gold and silver,\nbut there’s absolutely no life in it.”",
      "20": "The Lord is in his holy temple.\nAll the earth should be silent in his presence."

      "2": "Lord, I have heard the report about you.\nLord, I fear your work.\nIn the course of the years, renew it.\nIn the course of the years, reveal it.\nIn all this chaos, remember to be merciful.",
      "3": "God comes from Teman.\nThe Holy One comes from Mount Paran. Selah\nHis splendor covers the heavens.\nHis praise fills the earth.",
      "4": "His brightness is like the sunlight.\nRays of light stream from his hand.\nThat is where his power is hidden.",
      "5": "Diseases go ahead of him.\nPlagues follow after him.",
      "6": "He stands and shakes the earth.\nHe casts a glance and startles the nations.\nThe oldest mountains break apart.\nThe ancient hills sink.\nThe ancient paths belong to him.",
      "7": "I see trouble in the tents of Cushan.\nI see trembling in the tents of Midian.",
      "8": "The Lord is not angry with the rivers, is he?\nIf you are angry with the rivers,\nif you are furious with the sea,\nwhy do you ride your horses,\nyour chariots of salvation?",
      "9": "You get your bow ready for action,\nfor the arrows you promised. Selah\nYou split the land with rivers.",
      "10": "The mountains look at you. They writhe in pain.\nFloodwaters pass by.\nThe deep ocean roars. Its waves rise up high.",
      "11": "The sun and the moon stand still.\nThey scatter at the light of your arrows,\nat the bright lightning of your spear.",
      "12": "You march through the earth with fury.\nYou trample the nations in anger.",
      "13": "You go out to save your people,\nto save your anointed.\nYou crush the leader of the wicked household,\nstripping him bare from head to toe. Selah",
      "14": "You pierce the leader of his gang with his own arrows.\nHis soldiers come like a violent storm to scatter me.\nThey are arrogant like those who secretly eat up the poor.",
      "15": "You march with your horses into the sea,\ninto the mighty raging waters.",
      "16": "I have heard, so there’s trembling within me.\nAt the report my lips quivered.\nA rotten feeling has entered me.\nI tremble where I stand.\nI wait for the day of trouble\nto come to the people who will attack us.",
      "17": "Even if the fig tree does not bloom\nand the vines have no grapes,\neven if the olive tree fails to produce\nand the fields yield no food,\neven if the sheep pen is empty\nand the stalls have no cattle—",
      "18": "even then,\nI will be happy with the Lord.\nI will truly find joy in God, who saves me.",
      "19": "The Lord Almighty is my strength.\nHe makes my feet like those of a deer.\nHe makes me walk on the mountains."
