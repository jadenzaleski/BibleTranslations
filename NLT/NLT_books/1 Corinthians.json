      "1": "This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Sosthenes.",
      "2": "I am writing to God’s church in Corinth, to you who have been called by God to be his own holy people. He made you holy by means of Christ Jesus, just as he did for all people everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours.",
      "3": "May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.",
      "4": "I always thank my God for you and for the gracious gifts he has given you, now that you belong to Christ Jesus.",
      "5": "Through him, God has enriched your church in every way—with all of your eloquent words and all of your knowledge.",
      "6": "This confirms that what I told you about Christ is true.",
      "7": "Now you have every spiritual gift you need as you eagerly wait for the return of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be free from all blame on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns.",
      "9": "God will do this, for he is faithful to do what he says, and he has invited you into partnership with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "10": "I appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, to live in harmony with each other. Let there be no divisions in the church. Rather, be of one mind, united in thought and purpose.",
      "11": "For some members of Chloe’s household have told me about your quarrels, my dear brothers and sisters.",
      "12": "Some of you are saying, “I am a follower of Paul.” Others are saying, “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Peter,” or “I follow only Christ.”",
      "13": "Has Christ been divided into factions? Was I, Paul, crucified for you? Were any of you baptized in the name of Paul? Of course not!",
      "14": "I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,",
      "15": "for now no one can say they were baptized in my name.",
      "16": "(Oh yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas, but I don’t remember baptizing anyone else.)",
      "17": "For Christ didn’t send me to baptize, but to preach the Good News—and not with clever speech, for fear that the cross of Christ would lose its power.",
      "18": "The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God.",
      "19": "As the Scriptures say,\n“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise\n    and discard the intelligence of the intelligent.”",
      "20": "So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world’s brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish.",
      "21": "Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe.",
      "22": "It is foolish to the Jews, who ask for signs from heaven. And it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom.",
      "23": "So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it’s all nonsense.",
      "24": "But to those called by God to salvation, both Jews and Gentiles, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
      "25": "This foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God’s weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength.",
      "26": "Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world’s eyes or powerful or wealthy when God called you.",
      "27": "Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful.",
      "28": "God chose things despised by the world, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important.",
      "29": "As a result, no one can ever boast in the presence of God.",
      "30": "God has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made him to be wisdom itself. Christ made us right with God; he made us pure and holy, and he freed us from sin.",
      "31": "Therefore, as the Scriptures say, “If you want to boast, boast only about the Lord.”"

    "2": {
      "1": "When I first came to you, dear brothers and sisters, I didn’t use lofty words and impressive wisdom to tell you God’s secret plan.",
      "2": "For I decided that while I was with you I would forget everything except Jesus Christ, the one who was crucified.",
      "3": "I came to you in weakness—timid and trembling.",
      "4": "And my message and my preaching were very plain. Rather than using clever and persuasive speeches, I relied only on the power of the Holy Spirit.",
      "5": "I did this so you would trust not in human wisdom but in the power of God.",
      "6": "Yet when I am among mature believers, I do speak with words of wisdom, but not the kind of wisdom that belongs to this world or to the rulers of this world, who are soon forgotten.",
      "7": "No, the wisdom we speak of is the mystery of God—his plan that was previously hidden, even though he made it for our ultimate glory before the world began.",
      "8": "But the rulers of this world have not understood it; if they had, they would not have crucified our glorious Lord.",
      "9": "That is what the Scriptures mean when they say, \n“No eye has seen, no ear has heard,\n    and no mind has imagined\nwhat God has prepared\n    for those who love him.”",
      "10": "But it was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit. For his Spirit searches out everything and shows us God’s deep secrets.",
      "11": "No one can know a person’s thoughts except that person’s own spirit, and no one can know God’s thoughts except God’s own Spirit.",
      "12": "And we have received God’s Spirit (not the world’s spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us.",
      "13": "When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit’s words to explain spiritual truths.",
      "14": "But people who aren’t spiritual can’t receive these truths from God’s Spirit. It all sounds foolish to them and they can’t understand it, for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means.",
      "15": "Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things, but they themselves cannot be evaluated by others.",
      "16": "For,\n“Who can know the Lord’s thoughts?\n    Who knows enough to teach him?”\nBut we understand these things, for we have the mind of Christ."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Dear brothers and sisters, when I was with you I couldn’t talk to you as I would to spiritual people. I had to talk as though you belonged to this world or as though you were infants in Christ.",
      "2": "I had to feed you with milk, not with solid food, because you weren’t ready for anything stronger. And you still aren’t ready,",
      "3": "for you are still controlled by your sinful nature. You are jealous of one another and quarrel with each other. Doesn’t that prove you are controlled by your sinful nature? Aren’t you living like people of the world?",
      "4": "When one of you says, “I am a follower of Paul,” and another says, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you acting just like people of the world?",
      "5": "After all, who is Apollos? Who is Paul? We are only God’s servants through whom you believed the Good News. Each of us did the work the Lord gave us.",
      "6": "I planted the seed in your hearts, and Apollos watered it, but it was God who made it grow.",
      "7": "It’s not important who does the planting, or who does the watering. What’s important is that God makes the seed grow.",
      "8": "The one who plants and the one who waters work together with the same purpose. And both will be rewarded for their own hard work.",
      "9": "For we are both God’s workers. And you are God’s field. You are God’s building.",
      "10": "Because of God’s grace to me, I have laid the foundation like an expert builder. Now others are building on it. But whoever is building on this foundation must be very careful.",
      "11": "For no one can lay any foundation other than the one we already have—Jesus Christ.",
      "12": "Anyone who builds on that foundation may use a variety of materials—gold, silver, jewels, wood, hay, or straw.",
      "13": "But on the judgment day, fire will reveal what kind of work each builder has done. The fire will show if a person’s work has any value.",
      "14": "If the work survives, that builder will receive a reward.",
      "15": "But if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss. The builder will be saved, but like someone barely escaping through a wall of flames.",
      "16": "Don’t you realize that all of you together are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God lives in you?",
      "17": "God will destroy anyone who destroys this temple. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.",
      "18": "Stop deceiving yourselves. If you think you are wise by this world’s standards, you need to become a fool to be truly wise.",
      "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. As the Scriptures say,\n“He traps the wise\n    in the snare of their own cleverness.”",
      "20": "And again,\n“The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise;\n    he knows they are worthless.”",
      "21": "So don’t boast about following a particular human leader. For everything belongs to you—",
      "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Peter, or the world, or life and death, or the present and the future. Everything belongs to you,",
      "23": "and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "So look at Apollos and me as mere servants of Christ who have been put in charge of explaining God’s mysteries.",
      "2": "Now, a person who is put in charge as a manager must be faithful.",
      "3": "As for me, it matters very little how I might be evaluated by you or by any human authority. I don’t even trust my own judgment on this point.",
      "4": "My conscience is clear, but that doesn’t prove I’m right. It is the Lord himself who will examine me and decide.",
      "5": "So don’t make judgments about anyone ahead of time—before the Lord returns. For he will bring our darkest secrets to light and will reveal our private motives. Then God will give to each one whatever praise is due.",
      "6": "Dear brothers and sisters, I have used Apollos and myself to illustrate what I’ve been saying. If you pay attention to what I have quoted from the Scriptures, you won’t be proud of one of your leaders at the expense of another.",
      "7": "For what gives you the right to make such a judgment? What do you have that God hasn’t given you? And if everything you have is from God, why boast as though it were not a gift?",
      "8": "You think you already have everything you need. You think you are already rich. You have begun to reign in God’s kingdom without us! I wish you really were reigning already, for then we would be reigning with you.",
      "9": "Instead, I sometimes think God has put us apostles on display, like prisoners of war at the end of a victor’s parade, condemned to die. We have become a spectacle to the entire world—to people and angels alike.",
      "10": "Our dedication to Christ makes us look like fools, but you claim to be so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are so powerful! You are honored, but we are ridiculed.",
      "11": "Even now we go hungry and thirsty, and we don’t have enough clothes to keep warm. We are often beaten and have no home.",
      "12": "We work wearily with our own hands to earn our living. We bless those who curse us. We are patient with those who abuse us.",
      "13": "We appeal gently when evil things are said about us. Yet we are treated like the world’s garbage, like everybody’s trash—right up to the present moment.",
      "14": "I am not writing these things to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.",
      "15": "For even if you had ten thousand others to teach you about Christ, you have only one spiritual father. For I became your father in Christ Jesus when I preached the Good News to you.",
      "16": "So I urge you to imitate me.",
      "17": "That’s why I have sent Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of how I follow Christ Jesus, just as I teach in all the churches wherever I go.",
      "18": "Some of you have become arrogant, thinking I will not visit you again.",
      "19": "But I will come—and soon—if the Lord lets me, and then I’ll find out whether these arrogant people just give pretentious speeches or whether they really have God’s power.",
      "20": "For the Kingdom of God is not just a lot of talk; it is living by God’s power.",
      "21": "Which do you choose? Should I come with a rod to punish you, or should I come with love and a gentle spirit?"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "I can hardly believe the report about the sexual immorality going on among you—something that even pagans don’t do. I am told that a man in your church is living in sin with his stepmother.",
      "2": "You are so proud of yourselves, but you should be mourning in sorrow and shame. And you should remove this man from your fellowship.",
      "3": "Even though I am not with you in person, I am with you in the Spirit. And as though I were there, I have already passed judgment on this man",
      "4": "in the name of the Lord Jesus. You must call a meeting of the church. I will be present with you in spirit, and so will the power of our Lord Jesus.",
      "5": "Then you must throw this man out and hand him over to Satan so that his sinful nature will be destroyed and he himself will be saved on the day the Lord returns.",
      "6": "Your boasting about this is terrible. Don’t you realize that this sin is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough?",
      "7": "Get rid of the old “yeast” by removing this wicked person from among you. Then you will be like a fresh batch of dough made without yeast, which is what you really are. Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us.",
      "8": "So let us celebrate the festival, not with the old bread of wickedness and evil, but with the new bread of sincerity and truth.",
      "9": "When I wrote to you before, I told you not to associate with people who indulge in sexual sin.",
      "10": "But I wasn’t talking about unbelievers who indulge in sexual sin, or are greedy, or cheat people, or worship idols. You would have to leave this world to avoid people like that.",
      "11": "I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or is a drunkard, or cheats people. Don’t even eat with such people.",
      "12": "It isn’t my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning.",
      "13": "God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, “You must remove the evil person from among you.”"

      "2": "Don’t you realize that someday we believers will judge the world? And since you are going to judge the world, can’t you decide even these little things among yourselves?",
      "3": "Don’t you realize that we will judge angels? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life.",
      "4": "If you have legal disputes about such matters, why go to outside judges who are not respected by the church?",
      "5": "I am saying this to shame you. Isn’t there anyone in all the church who is wise enough to decide these issues?",
      "6": "But instead, one believer sues another—right in front of unbelievers!",
      "7": "Even to have such lawsuits with one another is a defeat for you. Why not just accept the injustice and leave it at that? Why not let yourselves be cheated?",
      "8": "Instead, you yourselves are the ones who do wrong and cheat even your fellow believers.",
      "9": "Don’t you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don’t fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality,",
      "10": "or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people—none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God.",
      "11": "Some of you were once like that. But you were cleansed; you were made holy; you were made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.",
      "12": "You say, “I am allowed to do anything”—but not everything is good for you. And even though “I am allowed to do anything,” I must not become a slave to anything.",
      "13": "You say, “Food was made for the stomach, and the stomach for food.” (This is true, though someday God will do away with both of them.) But you can’t say that our bodies were made for sexual immorality. They were made for the Lord, and the Lord cares about our bodies.",
      "14": "And God will raise us from the dead by his power, just as he raised our Lord from the dead.",
      "15": "Don’t you realize that your bodies are actually parts of Christ? Should a man take his body, which is part of Christ, and join it to a prostitute? Never!",
      "16": "And don’t you realize that if a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her? For the Scriptures say, “The two are united into one.”",
      "17": "But the person who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him.",
      "18": "Run from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body.",
      "19": "Don’t you realize that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself,",
      "20": "for God bought you with a high price. So you must honor God with your body."
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "Now regarding the questions you asked in your letter. Yes, it is good to abstain from sexual relations.",
      "2": "But because there is so much sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.",
      "3": "The husband should fulfill his wife’s sexual needs, and the wife should fulfill her husband’s needs.",
      "4": "The wife gives authority over her body to her husband, and the husband gives authority over his body to his wife.",
      "5": "Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won’t be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.",
      "6": "I say this as a concession, not as a command.",
      "7": "But I wish everyone were single, just as I am. Yet each person has a special gift from God, of one kind or another.",
      "8": "So I say to those who aren’t married and to widows—it’s better to stay unmarried, just as I am.",
      "9": "But if they can’t control themselves, they should go ahead and marry. It’s better to marry than to burn with lust.",
      "10": "But for those who are married, I have a command that comes not from me, but from the Lord. A wife must not leave her husband.",
      "11": "But if she does leave him, let her remain single or else be reconciled to him. And the husband must not leave his wife.",
      "12": "Now, I will speak to the rest of you, though I do not have a direct command from the Lord. If a fellow believer has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to continue living with him, he must not leave her.",
      "13": "And if a believing woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to continue living with her, she must not leave him.",
      "14": "For the believing wife brings holiness to her marriage, and the believing husband brings holiness to his marriage. Otherwise, your children would not be holy, but now they are holy.",
      "15": "(But if the husband or wife who isn’t a believer insists on leaving, let them go. In such cases the believing husband or wife is no longer bound to the other, for God has called you to live in peace.)",
      "16": "Don’t you wives realize that your husbands might be saved because of you? And don’t you husbands realize that your wives might be saved because of you?",
      "17": "Each of you should continue to live in whatever situation the Lord has placed you, and remain as you were when God first called you. This is my rule for all the churches.",
      "18": "For instance, a man who was circumcised before he became a believer should not try to reverse it. And the man who was uncircumcised when he became a believer should not be circumcised now.",
      "19": "For it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised. The important thing is to keep God’s commandments.",
      "20": "Yes, each of you should remain as you were when God called you.",
      "21": "Are you a slave? Don’t let that worry you—but if you get a chance to be free, take it.",
      "22": "And remember, if you were a slave when the Lord called you, you are now free in the Lord. And if you were free when the Lord called you, you are now a slave of Christ.",
      "23": "God paid a high price for you, so don’t be enslaved by the world.",
      "24": "Each of you, dear brothers and sisters, should remain as you were when God first called you.",
      "25": "Now regarding your question about the young women who are not yet married. I do not have a command from the Lord for them. But the Lord in his mercy has given me wisdom that can be trusted, and I will share it with you.",
      "26": "Because of the present crisis, I think it is best to remain as you are.",
      "27": "If you have a wife, do not seek to end the marriage. If you do not have a wife, do not seek to get married.",
      "28": "But if you do get married, it is not a sin. And if a young woman gets married, it is not a sin. However, those who get married at this time will have troubles, and I am trying to spare you those problems.",
      "29": "But let me say this, dear brothers and sisters: The time that remains is very short. So from now on, those with wives should not focus only on their marriage.",
      "30": "Those who weep or who rejoice or who buy things should not be absorbed by their weeping or their joy or their possessions.",
      "31": "Those who use the things of the world should not become attached to them. For this world as we know it will soon pass away.",
      "32": "I want you to be free from the concerns of this life. An unmarried man can spend his time doing the Lord’s work and thinking how to please him.",
      "33": "But a married man has to think about his earthly responsibilities and how to please his wife.",
      "34": "His interests are divided. In the same way, a woman who is no longer married or has never been married can be devoted to the Lord and holy in body and in spirit. But a married woman has to think about her earthly responsibilities and how to please her husband.",
      "35": "I am saying this for your benefit, not to place restrictions on you. I want you to do whatever will help you serve the Lord best, with as few distractions as possible.",
      "36": "But if a man thinks that he’s treating his fiancée improperly and will inevitably give in to his passion, let him marry her as he wishes. It is not a sin.",
      "37": "But if he has decided firmly not to marry and there is no urgency and he can control his passion, he does well not to marry.",
      "38": "So the person who marries his fiancée does well, and the person who doesn’t marry does even better.",
      "39": "A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but only if he loves the Lord.",
      "40": "But in my opinion it would be better for her to stay single, and I think I am giving you counsel from God’s Spirit when I say this."

      "1": "Now regarding your question about food that has been offered to idols. Yes, we know that “we all have knowledge” about this issue. But while knowledge makes us feel important, it is love that strengthens the church.",
      "2": "Anyone who claims to know all the answers doesn’t really know very much.",
      "3": "But the person who loves God is the one whom God recognizes.",
      "4": "So, what about eating meat that has been offered to idols? Well, we all know that an idol is not really a god and that there is only one God.",
      "5": "There may be so-called gods both in heaven and on earth, and some people actually worship many gods and many lords.",
      "6": "But for us,\nThere is one God, the Father,\n    by whom all things were created,\n    and for whom we live.\nAnd there is one Lord, Jesus Christ,\n    through whom all things were created,\n    and through whom we live.",
      "7": "However, not all believers know this. Some are accustomed to thinking of idols as being real, so when they eat food that has been offered to idols, they think of it as the worship of real gods, and their weak consciences are violated.",
      "8": "It’s true that we can’t win God’s approval by what we eat. We don’t lose anything if we don’t eat it, and we don’t gain anything if we do.",
      "9": "But you must be careful so that your freedom does not cause others with a weaker conscience to stumble.",
      "10": "For if others see you—with your “superior knowledge”—eating in the temple of an idol, won’t they be encouraged to violate their conscience by eating food that has been offered to an idol?",
      "11": "So because of your superior knowledge, a weak believer for whom Christ died will be destroyed.",
      "12": "And when you sin against other believers by encouraging them to do something they believe is wrong, you are sinning against Christ.",
      "13": "So if what I eat causes another believer to sin, I will never eat meat again as long as I live—for I don’t want to cause another believer to stumble."

      "5": "Don’t we have the right to bring a believing wife with us as the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers do, and as Peter does?",
      "6": "Or is it only Barnabas and I who have to work to support ourselves?",
      "7": "What soldier has to pay his own expenses? What farmer plants a vineyard and doesn’t have the right to eat some of its fruit? What shepherd cares for a flock of sheep and isn’t allowed to drink some of the milk?",
      "8": "Am I expressing merely a human opinion, or does the law say the same thing?",
      "9": "For the law of Moses says, “You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain.” Was God thinking only about oxen when he said this?",
      "10": "Wasn’t he actually speaking to us? Yes, it was written for us, so that the one who plows and the one who threshes the grain might both expect a share of the harvest.",
      "11": "Since we have planted spiritual seed among you, aren’t we entitled to a harvest of physical food and drink?",

      "38": "Then God gives it the new body he wants it to have. A different plant grows from each kind of seed.",
      "39": "Similarly there are different kinds of flesh—one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.",
      "40": "There are also bodies in the heavens and bodies on the earth. The glory of the heavenly bodies is different from the glory of the earthly bodies.",
      "41": "The sun has one kind of glory, while the moon and stars each have another kind. And even the stars differ from each other in their glory.",
      "42": "It is the same way with the resurrection of the dead. Our earthly bodies are planted in the ground when we die, but they will be raised to live forever.",
      "43": "Our bodies are buried in brokenness, but they will be raised in glory. They are buried in weakness, but they will be raised in strength.",
      "44": "They are buried as natural human bodies, but they will be raised as spiritual bodies. For just as there are natural bodies, there are also spiritual bodies.",
      "45": "The Scriptures tell us, “The first man, Adam, became a living person.” But the last Adam—that is, Christ—is a life-giving Spirit.",
      "46": "What comes first is the natural body, then the spiritual body comes later.",
      "47": "Adam, the first man, was made from the dust of the earth, while Christ, the second man, came from heaven.",
      "48": "Earthly people are like the earthly man, and heavenly people are like the heavenly man.",
      "49": "Just as we are now like the earthly man, we will someday be like the heavenly man.",
      "50": "What I am saying, dear brothers and sisters, is that our physical bodies cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. These dying bodies cannot inherit what will last forever.",
      "51": "But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!",
      "52": "It will happen in a moment, in the blink of an eye, when the last trumpet is blown. For when the trumpet sounds, those who have died will be raised to live forever. And we who are living will also be transformed.",
      "53": "For our dying bodies must be transformed into bodies that will never die; our mortal bodies must be transformed into immortal bodies.",
      "54": "Then, when our dying bodies have been transformed into bodies that will never die, this Scripture will be fulfilled:\n“Death is swallowed up in victory.",
      "55": "O death, where is your victory?\n    O death, where is your sting?”",
      "56": "For sin is the sting that results in death, and the law gives sin its power.",
      "57": "But thank God! He gives us victory over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "58": "So, my dear brothers and sisters, be strong and immovable. Always work enthusiastically for the Lord, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless."
