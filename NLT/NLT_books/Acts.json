      "3": "During the forty days after he suffered and died, he appeared to the apostles from time to time, and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive. And he talked to them about the Kingdom of God.",
      "4": "Once when he was eating with them, he commanded them, “Do not leave Jerusalem until the Father sends you the gift he promised, as I told you before.",
      "5": "John baptized with water, but in just a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”",
      "6": "So when the apostles were with Jesus, they kept asking him, “Lord, has the time come for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom?”",
      "7": "He replied, “The Father alone has the authority to set those dates and times, and they are not for you to know.",
      "8": "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere—in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”",
      "9": "After saying this, he was taken up into a cloud while they were watching, and they could no longer see him.",
      "10": "As they strained to see him rising into heaven, two white-robed men suddenly stood among them.",
      "11": "“Men of Galilee,” they said, “why are you standing here staring into heaven? Jesus has been taken from you into heaven, but someday he will return from heaven in the same way you saw him go!”",
      "12": "Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, a distance of half a mile.",
      "13": "When they arrived, they went to the upstairs room of the house where they were staying.\nHere are the names of those who were present: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon (the zealot), and Judas (son of James).",
      "14": "They all met together and were constantly united in prayer, along with Mary the mother of Jesus, several other women, and the brothers of Jesus.",
      "15": "During this time, when about 120 believers were together in one place, Peter stood up and addressed them.",
      "16": "“Brothers,” he said, “the Scriptures had to be fulfilled concerning Judas, who guided those who arrested Jesus. This was predicted long ago by the Holy Spirit, speaking through King David.",
      "17": "Judas was one of us and shared in the ministry with us.”",
      "18": "(Judas had bought a field with the money he received for his treachery. Falling headfirst there, his body split open, spilling out all his intestines.",
      "19": "The news of his death spread to all the people of Jerusalem, and they gave the place the Aramaic name Akeldama, which means “Field of Blood.”)",
      "20": "Peter continued, “This was written in the book of Psalms, where it says, ‘Let his home become desolate, with no one living in it.’ It also says, ‘Let someone else take his position.’",
      "21": "“So now we must choose a replacement for Judas from among the men who were with us the entire time we were traveling with the Lord Jesus—",
      "22": "from the time he was baptized by John until the day he was taken from us. Whoever is chosen will join us as a witness of Jesus’ resurrection.”",
      "23": "So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.",
      "24": "Then they all prayed, “O Lord, you know every heart. Show us which of these men you have chosen",
      "25": "as an apostle to replace Judas in this ministry, for he has deserted us and gone where he belongs.”",
      "26": "Then they cast lots, and Matthias was selected to become an apostle with the other eleven."

      "5": "At that time there were devout Jews from every nation living in Jerusalem.",
      "6": "When they heard the loud noise, everyone came running, and they were bewildered to hear their own languages being spoken by the believers.",

      "8": "and yet we hear them speaking in our own native languages!",
      "9": "Here we are—Parthians, Medes, Elamites, people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, the province of Asia,",
      "10": "Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the areas of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome",

      "13": "But others in the crowd ridiculed them, saying, “They’re just drunk, that’s all!”",

      "15": "These people are not drunk, as some of you are assuming. Nine o’clock in the morning is much too early for that.",
      "16": "No, what you see was predicted long ago by the prophet Joel:",

      "23": "But God knew what would happen, and his prearranged plan was carried out when Jesus was betrayed. With the help of lawless Gentiles, you nailed him to a cross and killed him.",

      "29": "“Dear brothers, think about this! You can be sure that the patriarch David wasn’t referring to himself, for he died and was buried, and his tomb is still here among us.",
      "30": "But he was a prophet, and he knew God had promised with an oath that one of David’s own descendants would sit on his throne.",
      "31": "David was looking into the future and speaking of the Messiah’s resurrection. He was saying that God would not leave him among the dead or allow his body to rot in the grave.",
      "32": "“God raised Jesus from the dead, and we are all witnesses of this.",
      "33": "Now he is exalted to the place of highest honor in heaven, at God’s right hand. And the Father, as he had promised, gave him the Holy Spirit to pour out upon us, just as you see and hear today.",
      "34": "For David himself never ascended into heaven, yet he said,\n‘The Lord said to my Lord,\n    “Sit in the place of honor at my right hand",
      "35": "until I humble your enemies,\n    making them a footstool under your feet.”’",

      "39": "This promise is to you, to your children, and to those far away—all who have been called by the Lord our God.”",
      "40": "Then Peter continued preaching for a long time, strongly urging all his listeners, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation!”",
      "41": "Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church that day—about 3,000 in all.",
      "42": "All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, and to fellowship, and to sharing in meals (including the Lord’s Supper), and to prayer.",

      "13": "For it is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the God of all our ancestors—who has brought glory to his servant Jesus by doing this. This is the same Jesus whom you handed over and rejected before Pilate, despite Pilate’s decision to release him.",
      "14": "You rejected this holy, righteous one and instead demanded the release of a murderer.",

      "24": "“Starting with Samuel, every prophet spoke about what is happening today.",
      "25": "You are the children of those prophets, and you are included in the covenant God promised to your ancestors. For God said to Abraham, ‘Through your descendants all the families on earth will be blessed.’",

      "11": "And the people of Berea were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, and they listened eagerly to Paul’s message. They searched the Scriptures day after day to see if Paul and Silas were teaching the truth.",
      "12": "As a result, many Jews believed, as did many of the prominent Greek women and men.",

      "17": "He went to the synagogue to reason with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and he spoke daily in the public square to all who happened to be there.",
      "18": "He also had a debate with some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers. When he told them about Jesus and his resurrection, they said, “What’s this babbler trying to say with these strange ideas he’s picked up?” Others said, “He seems to be preaching about some foreign gods.”",
      "19": "Then they took him to the high council of the city. “Come and tell us about this new teaching,” they said.",
      "20": "“You are saying some rather strange things, and we want to know what it’s all about.”",
      "21": "(It should be explained that all the Athenians as well as the foreigners in Athens seemed to spend all their time discussing the latest ideas.)",
      "22": "So Paul, standing before the council, addressed them as follows: “Men of Athens, I notice that you are very religious in every way,",
      "23": "for as I was walking along I saw your many shrines. And one of your altars had this inscription on it: ‘To an Unknown God.’ This God, whom you worship without knowing, is the one I’m telling you about.",
      "24": "“He is the God who made the world and everything in it. Since he is Lord of heaven and earth, he doesn’t live in man-made temples,",
      "25": "and human hands can’t serve his needs—for he has no needs. He himself gives life and breath to everything, and he satisfies every need.",
      "26": "From one man he created all the nations throughout the whole earth. He decided beforehand when they should rise and fall, and he determined their boundaries.",
      "27": "“His purpose was for the nations to seek after God and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him—though he is not far from any one of us.",
      "28": "For in him we live and move and exist. As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’",
      "29": "And since this is true, we shouldn’t think of God as an idol designed by craftsmen from gold or silver or stone.",
      "30": "“God overlooked people’s ignorance about these things in earlier times, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent of their sins and turn to him.",
      "31": "For he has set a day for judging the world with justice by the man he has appointed, and he proved to everyone who this is by raising him from the dead.”",
      "32": "When they heard Paul speak about the resurrection of the dead, some laughed in contempt, but others said, “We want to hear more about this later.”",
