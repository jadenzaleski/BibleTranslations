      "1": "On July 31 of my thirtieth year, while I was with the Judean exiles beside the Kebar River in Babylon, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.",
      "2": "This happened during the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity.",
      "3": "(The Lord gave this message to Ezekiel son of Buzi, a priest, beside the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians, and he felt the hand of the Lord take hold of him.)",
      "4": "As I looked, I saw a great storm coming from the north, driving before it a huge cloud that flashed with lightning and shone with brilliant light. There was fire inside the cloud, and in the middle of the fire glowed something like gleaming amber.",
      "5": "From the center of the cloud came four living beings that looked human,",
      "6": "except that each had four faces and four wings.",
      "7": "Their legs were straight, and their feet had hooves like those of a calf and shone like burnished bronze.",
      "8": "Under each of their four wings I could see human hands. So each of the four beings had four faces and four wings.",
      "9": "The wings of each living being touched the wings of the beings beside it. Each one moved straight forward in any direction without turning around.",
      "10": "Each had a human face in the front, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle at the back.",
      "11": "Each had two pairs of outstretched wings—one pair stretched out to touch the wings of the living beings on either side of it, and the other pair covered its body.",
      "12": "They went in whatever direction the spirit chose, and they moved straight forward in any direction without turning around.",
      "13": "The living beings looked like bright coals of fire or brilliant torches, and lightning seemed to flash back and forth among them.",
      "14": "And the living beings darted to and fro like flashes of lightning.",
      "15": "As I looked at these beings, I saw four wheels touching the ground beside them, one wheel belonging to each.",
      "16": "The wheels sparkled as if made of beryl. All four wheels looked alike and were made the same; each wheel had a second wheel turning crosswise within it.",
      "17": "The beings could move in any of the four directions they faced, without turning as they moved.",
      "18": "The rims of the four wheels were tall and frightening, and they were covered with eyes all around.",
      "19": "When the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. When they flew upward, the wheels went up, too.",
      "20": "The spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. So wherever the spirit went, the wheels and the living beings also went.",
      "21": "When the beings moved, the wheels moved. When the beings stopped, the wheels stopped. When the beings flew upward, the wheels rose up, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.",
      "22": "Spread out above them was a surface like the sky, glittering like crystal.",
      "23": "Beneath this surface the wings of each living being stretched out to touch the others’ wings, and each had two wings covering its body.",
      "24": "As they flew, their wings sounded to me like waves crashing against the shore or like the voice of the Almighty or like the shouting of a mighty army. When they stopped, they let down their wings.",
      "25": "As they stood with wings lowered, a voice spoke from beyond the crystal surface above them.",
      "26": "Above this surface was something that looked like a throne made of blue lapis lazuli. And on this throne high above was a figure whose appearance resembled a man.",
      "27": "From what appeared to be his waist up, he looked like gleaming amber, flickering like a fire. And from his waist down, he looked like a burning flame, shining with splendor.",
      "28": "All around him was a glowing halo, like a rainbow shining in the clouds on a rainy day. This is what the glory of the Lord looked like to me. When I saw it, I fell face down on the ground, and I heard someone’s voice speaking to me."

    "2": {
      "1": "“Stand up, son of man,” said the voice. “I want to speak with you.”",
      "2": "The Spirit came into me as he spoke, and he set me on my feet. I listened carefully to his words.",
      "3": "“Son of man,” he said, “I am sending you to the nation of Israel, a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me. They and their ancestors have been rebelling against me to this very day.",
      "4": "They are a stubborn and hard-hearted people. But I am sending you to say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says!’",
      "5": "And whether they listen or refuse to listen—for remember, they are rebels—at least they will know they have had a prophet among them.",
      "6": "“Son of man, do not fear them or their words. Don’t be afraid even though their threats surround you like nettles and briers and stinging scorpions. Do not be dismayed by their dark scowls, even though they are rebels.",
      "7": "You must give them my messages whether they listen or not. But they won’t listen, for they are completely rebellious!",
      "8": "Son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not join them in their rebellion. Open your mouth, and eat what I give you.”",
      "9": "Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me. It held a scroll,",
      "10": "which he unrolled. And I saw that both sides were covered with funeral songs, words of sorrow, and pronouncements of doom."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "The voice said to me, “Son of man, eat what I am giving you—eat this scroll! Then go and give its message to the people of Israel.”",
      "2": "So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll.",
      "3": "“Fill your stomach with this,” he said. And when I ate it, it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.",
      "4": "Then he said, “Son of man, go to the people of Israel and give them my messages.",
      "5": "I am not sending you to a foreign people whose language you cannot understand.",
      "6": "No, I am not sending you to people with strange and difficult speech. If I did, they would listen!",
      "7": "But the people of Israel won’t listen to you any more than they listen to me! For the whole lot of them are hard-hearted and stubborn.",
      "8": "But look, I have made you as obstinate and hard-hearted as they are.",
      "9": "I have made your forehead as hard as the hardest rock! So don’t be afraid of them or fear their angry looks, even though they are rebels.”",
      "10": "Then he added, “Son of man, let all my words sink deep into your own heart first. Listen to them carefully for yourself.",
      "11": "Then go to your people in exile and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says!’ Do this whether they listen to you or not.”",
      "12": "Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me. (May the glory of the Lord be praised in his place!)",
      "13": "It was the sound of the wings of the living beings as they brushed against each other and the rumbling of their wheels beneath them.",
      "14": "The Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I went in bitterness and turmoil, but the Lord’s hold on me was strong.",
      "15": "Then I came to the colony of Judean exiles in Tel-abib, beside the Kebar River. I was overwhelmed and sat among them for seven days.",
      "16": "After seven days the Lord gave me a message. He said,",
      "17": "“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for Israel. Whenever you receive a message from me, warn people immediately.",
      "18": "If I warn the wicked, saying, ‘You are under the penalty of death,’ but you fail to deliver the warning, they will die in their sins. And I will hold you responsible for their deaths.",
      "19": "If you warn them and they refuse to repent and keep on sinning, they will die in their sins. But you will have saved yourself because you obeyed me.",
      "20": "“If righteous people turn away from their righteous behavior and ignore the obstacles I put in their way, they will die. And if you do not warn them, they will die in their sins. None of their righteous acts will be remembered, and I will hold you responsible for their deaths.",
      "21": "But if you warn righteous people not to sin and they listen to you and do not sin, they will live, and you will have saved yourself, too.”",
      "22": "Then the Lord took hold of me and said, “Get up and go out into the valley, and I will speak to you there.”",
      "23": "So I got up and went, and there I saw the glory of the Lord, just as I had seen in my first vision by the Kebar River. And I fell face down on the ground.",
      "24": "Then the Spirit came into me and set me on my feet. He spoke to me and said, “Go to your house and shut yourself in.",
      "25": "There, son of man, you will be tied with ropes so you cannot go out among the people.",
      "26": "And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be speechless and unable to rebuke them, for they are rebels.",
      "27": "But when I give you a message, I will loosen your tongue and let you speak. Then you will say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says!’ Those who choose to listen will listen, but those who refuse will refuse, for they are rebels."

      "1": "“And now, son of man, take a large clay brick and set it down in front of you. Then draw a map of the city of Jerusalem on it.",
      "2": "Show the city under siege. Build a wall around it so no one can escape. Set up the enemy camp, and surround the city with siege ramps and battering rams.",
      "3": "Then take an iron griddle and place it between you and the city. Turn toward the city and demonstrate how harsh the siege will be against Jerusalem. This will be a warning to the people of Israel.",
      "4": "“Now lie on your left side and place the sins of Israel on yourself. You are to bear their sins for the number of days you lie there on your side.",
      "5": "I am requiring you to bear Israel’s sins for 390 days—one day for each year of their sin.",
      "6": "After that, turn over and lie on your right side for 40 days—one day for each year of Judah’s sin.",
      "7": "“Meanwhile, keep staring at the siege of Jerusalem. Lie there with your arm bared and prophesy her destruction.",
      "8": "I will tie you up with ropes so you won’t be able to turn from side to side until the days of your siege have been completed.",
      "9": "“Now go and get some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and emmer wheat, and mix them together in a storage jar. Use them to make bread for yourself during the 390 days you will be lying on your side.",
      "10": "Ration this out to yourself, eight ounces of food for each day, and eat it at set times.",
      "11": "Then measure out a jar of water for each day, and drink it at set times.",
      "12": "Prepare and eat this food as you would barley cakes. While all the people are watching, bake it over a fire using dried human dung as fuel and then eat the bread.”",
      "13": "Then the Lord said, “This is how Israel will eat defiled bread in the Gentile lands to which I will banish them!”",
      "14": "Then I said, “O Sovereign Lord, must I be defiled by using human dung? For I have never been defiled before. From the time I was a child until now I have never eaten any animal that died of sickness or was killed by other animals. I have never eaten any meat forbidden by the law.”",
      "15": "“All right,” the Lord said. “You may bake your bread with cow dung instead of human dung.”",
      "16": "Then he told me, “Son of man, I will make food very scarce in Jerusalem. It will be weighed out with great care and eaten fearfully. The water will be rationed out drop by drop, and the people will drink it with dismay.",

      "3": "Keep just a bit of the hair and tie it up in your robe.",
      "4": "Then take some of these hairs out and throw them into the fire, burning them up. A fire will then spread from this remnant and destroy all of Israel.",

      "9": "“And so I handed her over to her Assyrian lovers, whom she desired so much.",
      "10": "They stripped her, took away her children as their slaves, and then killed her. After she received her punishment, her reputation was known to every woman in the land.",

      "13": "I saw the way she was going, defiling herself just like her older sister.",

And because these rooms are holy, they will be used to store the sacred offerings—the grain offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings.",
      "14": "When the priests leave the sanctuary, they must not go directly to the outer courtyard. They must first take off the clothes they wore while ministering, because these clothes are holy. They must put on other clothes before entering the parts of the building complex open to the public.”",

      "5": "Then he measured another 1,750 feet, and the river was too deep to walk across. It was deep enough to swim in, but too deep to walk through.",
      "6": "He asked me, “Have you been watching, son of man?” Then he led me back along the riverbank.",
      "7": "When I returned, I was surprised by the sight of many trees growing on both sides of the river.",
      "8": "Then he said to me, “This river flows east through the desert into the valley of the Dead Sea. The waters of this stream will make the salty waters of the Dead Sea fresh and pure.",
      "9": "There will be swarms of living things wherever the water of this river flows. Fish will abound in the Dead Sea, for its waters will become fresh. Life will flourish wherever this water flows.",
      "10": "Fishermen will stand along the shores of the Dead Sea. All the way from En-gedi to En-eglaim, the shores will be covered with nets drying in the sun. Fish of every kind will fill the Dead Sea, just as they fill the Mediterranean.",
      "11": "But the marshes and swamps will not be purified; they will still be salty.",
      "12": "Fruit trees of all kinds will grow along both sides of the river. The leaves of these trees will never turn brown and fall, and there will always be fruit on their branches. There will be a new crop every month, for they are watered by the river flowing from the Temple. The fruit will be for food and the leaves for healing.”",
      "13": "This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “Divide the land in this way for the twelve tribes of Israel: The descendants of Joseph will be given two shares of land.",
      "14": "Otherwise each tribe will receive an equal share. I took a solemn oath and swore that I would give this land to your ancestors, and it will now come to you as your possession.",
      "15": "“These are the boundaries of the land: The northern border will run from the Mediterranean toward Hethlon, then on through Lebo-hamath to Zedad;",
      "16": "then it will run to Berothah and Sibraim, which are on the border between Damascus and Hamath, and finally to Hazer-hatticon, on the border of Hauran.",
      "17": "So the northern border will run from the Mediterranean to Hazar-enan, on the border between Hamath to the north and Damascus to the south.",
      "18": "“The eastern border starts at a point between Hauran and Damascus and runs south along the Jordan River between Israel and Gilead, past the Dead Sea and as far south as Tamar. This will be the eastern border.",
      "19": "“The southern border will go west from Tamar to the waters of Meribah at Kadesh and then follow the course of the Brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean. This will be the southern border.",
      "20": "“On the west side, the Mediterranean itself will be your border from the southern border to the point where the northern border begins, opposite Lebo-hamath.",
      "21": "“Divide the land within these boundaries among the tribes of Israel.",
      "22": "Distribute the land as an allotment for yourselves and for the foreigners who have joined you and are raising their families among you. They will be like native-born Israelites to you and will receive an allotment among the tribes.",
      "23": "These foreigners are to be given land within the territory of the tribe with whom they now live. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!"

      "1": "“Here is the list of the tribes of Israel and the territory each is to receive. The territory of Dan is in the extreme north. Its boundary line follows the Hethlon road to Lebo-hamath and then runs on to Hazar-enan on the border of Damascus, with Hamath to the north. Dan’s territory extends all the way across the land of Israel from east to west.",
      "2": "“Asher’s territory lies south of Dan’s and also extends from east to west.",
      "3": "Naphtali’s land lies south of Asher’s, also extending from east to west.",

      "9": "“The area set aside for the Lord’s Temple will be 8 1⁄3 miles long and 6 2⁄3 miles wide.",
      "10": "For the priests there will be a strip of land measuring 8 1⁄3 miles long by 3 1⁄3 miles wide, with the Lord’s Temple at the center.",
      "11": "This area is set aside for the ordained priests, the descendants of Zadok who served me faithfully and did not go astray with the people of Israel and the rest of the Levites.",
      "12": "It will be their special portion when the land is distributed, the most sacred land of all. Next to the priests’ territory will lie the land where the other Levites will live.",
      "13": "“The land allotted to the Levites will be the same size and shape as that belonging to the priests—8 1⁄3 miles long and 3 1⁄3 miles wide. Together these portions of land will measure 8 1⁄3 miles long by 6 2⁄3 miles wide.",
      "14": "None of this special land may ever be sold or traded or used by others, for it belongs to the Lord; it is set apart as holy.",
      "15": "“An additional strip of land 8 1⁄3 miles long by 1 2⁄3 miles wide, south of the sacred Temple area, will be allotted for public use—homes, pasturelands, and common lands, with a city at the center.",
      "16": "The city will measure 1 1⁄2 miles on each side—north, south, east, and west.",
      "17": "Open lands will surround the city for 150 yards in every direction.",
      "18": "Outside the city there will be a farming area that stretches 3 1⁄3 miles to the east and 3 1⁄3 miles to the west along the border of the sacred area. This farmland will produce food for the people working in the city.",
      "19": "Those who come from the various tribes to work in the city may farm it.",
      "20": "This entire area—including the sacred lands and the city—is a square that measures 8 1⁄3 miles on each side.",

Each of these areas will be 8 1⁄3 miles wide, extending in opposite directions to the eastern and western borders of Israel, with the sacred lands and the sanctuary of the Temple in the center.",
      "22": "So the prince’s land will include everything between the territories allotted to Judah and Benjamin, except for the areas set aside for the sacred lands and the city.",
      "23": "“These are the territories allotted to the rest of the tribes. Benjamin’s territory lies just south of the prince’s lands, and it extends across the entire land of Israel from east to west.",
      "24": "South of Benjamin’s territory lies that of Simeon, also extending across the land from east to west.",
      "25": "Next is the territory of Issachar with the same eastern and western boundaries.",
      "26": "“Then comes the territory of Zebulun, which also extends across the land from east to west.",
      "27": "The territory of Gad is just south of Zebulun with the same borders to the east and west.",
      "28": "The southern border of Gad runs from Tamar to the waters of Meribah at Kadesh and then follows the Brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean.",
      "29": "“These are the allotments that will be set aside for each tribe’s exclusive possession. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!",

      "31": "there will be three gates, each one named after a tribe of Israel. The first will be named for Reuben, the second for Judah, and the third for Levi.",
