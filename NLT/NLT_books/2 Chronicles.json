      "1": "Solomon son of David took firm control of his kingdom, for the Lord his God was with him and made him very powerful.",
      "2": "Solomon called together all the leaders of Israel—the generals and captains of the army, the judges, and all the political and clan leaders.",
      "3": "Then he led the entire assembly to the place of worship in Gibeon, for God’s Tabernacle was located there. (This was the Tabernacle that Moses, the Lord’s servant, had made in the wilderness.)",
      "4": "David had already moved the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the tent he had prepared for it in Jerusalem.",
      "5": "But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri and grandson of Hur was there at Gibeon in front of the Tabernacle of the Lord. So Solomon and the people gathered in front of it to consult the Lord.",
      "6": "There in front of the Tabernacle, Solomon went up to the bronze altar in the Lord’s presence and sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings on it.",
      "7": "That night God appeared to Solomon and said, “What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!”",
      "8": "Solomon replied to God, “You showed great and faithful love to David, my father, and now you have made me king in his place.",
      "9": "O Lord God, please continue to keep your promise to David my father, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth!",
      "10": "Give me the wisdom and knowledge to lead them properly, for who could possibly govern this great people of yours?”",
      "11": "God said to Solomon, “Because your greatest desire is to help your people, and you did not ask for wealth, riches, fame, or even the death of your enemies or a long life, but rather you asked for wisdom and knowledge to properly govern my people—",
      "12": "I will certainly give you the wisdom and knowledge you requested. But I will also give you wealth, riches, and fame such as no other king has had before you or will ever have in the future!”",
      "13": "Then Solomon returned to Jerusalem from the Tabernacle at the place of worship in Gibeon, and he reigned over Israel.",
      "14": "Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. He stationed some of them in the chariot cities and some near him in Jerusalem.",
      "15": "The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah.",
      "16": "Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Cilicia; the king’s traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price.",
      "17": "At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver, and horses for 150 pieces of silver. They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram."

      "1": "Solomon decided to build a Temple to honor the name of the Lord, and also a royal palace for himself.",

      "3": "Solomon also sent this message to King Hiram at Tyre:\n“Send me cedar logs as you did for my father, David, when he was building his palace.",
      "4": "I am about to build a Temple to honor the name of the Lord my God. It will be a place set apart to burn fragrant incense before him, to display the special sacrificial bread, and to sacrifice burnt offerings each morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, at new moon celebrations, and at the other appointed festivals of the Lord our God. He has commanded Israel to do these things forever.",
      "5": "“This must be a magnificent Temple because our God is greater than all other gods.",
      "6": "But who can really build him a worthy home? Not even the highest heavens can contain him! So who am I to consider building a Temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices to him?",
      "7": "“So send me a master craftsman who can work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as with purple, scarlet, and blue cloth. He must be a skilled engraver who can work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem who were selected by my father, David.",
      "8": "“Also send me cedar, cypress, and red sandalwood logs from Lebanon, for I know that your men are without equal at cutting timber in Lebanon. I will send my men to help them.",
      "9": "An immense amount of timber will be needed, for the Temple I am going to build will be very large and magnificent.",
      "10": "In payment for your woodcutters, I will send 100,000 bushels of crushed wheat, 100,000 bushels of barley, 110,000 gallons of wine, and 110,000 gallons of olive oil.”",
      "11": "King Hiram sent this letter of reply to Solomon:\n“It is because the Lord loves his people that he has made you their king!",
      "12": "Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth! He has given King David a wise son, gifted with skill and understanding, who will build a Temple for the Lord and a royal palace for himself.",

      "14": "His mother is from the tribe of Dan in Israel, and his father is from Tyre. He is skillful at making things from gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and he also works with stone and wood. He can work with purple, blue, and scarlet cloth and fine linen. He is also an engraver and can follow any design given to him. He will work with your craftsmen and those appointed by my lord David, your father.",
      "15": "“Send along the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine that my lord has mentioned.",
      "16": "We will cut whatever timber you need from the Lebanon mountains and will float the logs in rafts down the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to Joppa. From there you can transport the logs up to Jerusalem.”",
      "17": "Solomon took a census of all foreigners in the land of Israel, like the census his father had taken, and he counted 153,600.",
      "18": "He assigned 70,000 of them as common laborers, 80,000 as quarry workers in the hill country, and 3,600 as foremen."

      "1": "So Solomon began to build the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to David, his father. The Temple was built on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, the site that David had selected.",
      "2": "The construction began in midspring, during the fourth year of Solomon’s reign.",
      "3": "These are the dimensions Solomon used for the foundation of the Temple of God (using the old standard of measurement). It was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide.",
      "4": "The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet wide, running across the entire width of the Temple, and 30 feet high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.",
      "5": "He paneled the main room of the Temple with cypress wood, overlaid it with fine gold, and decorated it with carvings of palm trees and chains.",
      "6": "He decorated the walls of the Temple with beautiful jewels and with gold from the land of Parvaim.",
      "7": "He overlaid the beams, thresholds, walls, and doors throughout the Temple with gold, and he carved figures of cherubim on the walls.",
      "8": "He made the Most Holy Place 30 feet wide, corresponding to the width of the Temple, and 30 feet deep. He overlaid its interior with 23 tons of fine gold.",
      "9": "The gold nails that were used weighed 20 ounces each. He also overlaid the walls of the upper rooms with gold.",
      "10": "He made two figures shaped like cherubim, overlaid them with gold, and placed them in the Most Holy Place.",
      "11": "The total wingspan of the two cherubim standing side by side was 30 feet. One wing of the first figure was 7 1⁄2 feet long, and it touched the Temple wall. The other wing, also 7 1⁄2 feet long, touched one of the wings of the second figure.",
      "12": "In the same way, the second figure had one wing 7 1⁄2 feet long that touched the opposite wall. The other wing, also 7 1⁄2 feet long, touched the wing of the first figure.",
      "13": "So the wingspan of the two cherubim side by side was 30 feet. They stood on their feet and faced out toward the main room of the Temple.",
      "14": "Across the entrance of the Most Holy Place he hung a curtain made of fine linen, decorated with blue, purple, and scarlet thread and embroidered with figures of cherubim.",
      "15": "For the front of the Temple, he made two pillars that were 27 feet tall, each topped by a capital extending upward another 7 1⁄2 feet.",
      "16": "He made a network of interwoven chains and used them to decorate the tops of the pillars. He also made 100 decorative pomegranates and attached them to the chains.",
      "17": "Then he set up the two pillars at the entrance of the Temple, one to the south of the entrance and the other to the north. He named the one on the south Jakin, and the one on the north Boaz."

      "1": "Solomon also made a bronze altar 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet high.",
      "2": "Then he cast a great round basin, 15 feet across from rim to rim, called the Sea. It was 7 1⁄2 feet deep and about 45 feet in circumference.",
      "3": "It was encircled just below its rim by two rows of figures that resembled oxen. There were about six oxen per foot all the way around, and they were cast as part of the basin.",
      "4": "The Sea was placed on a base of twelve bronze oxen, all facing outward. Three faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east, and the Sea rested on them.",
      "5": "The walls of the Sea were about three inches thick, and its rim flared out like a cup and resembled a water lily blossom. It could hold about 16,500 gallons of water.",
      "6": "He also made ten smaller basins for washing the utensils for the burnt offerings. He set five on the south side and five on the north. But the priests washed themselves in the Sea.",
      "7": "He then cast ten gold lampstands according to the specifications that had been given, and he put them in the Temple. Five were placed against the south wall, and five were placed against the north wall.",
      "8": "He also built ten tables and placed them in the Temple, five along the south wall and five along the north wall. Then he molded 100 gold basins.",
      "9": "He then built a courtyard for the priests, and also the large outer courtyard. He made doors for the courtyard entrances and overlaid them with bronze.",
      "10": "The great bronze basin called the Sea was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple.",
      "11": "Huram-abi also made the necessary washbasins, shovels, and bowls.\nSo at last Huram-abi completed everything King Solomon had assigned him to make for the Temple of God:",

      "16": "the ash buckets, the shovels, the meat hooks, and all the related articles.\nHuram-abi made all these things of burnished bronze for the Temple of the Lord, just as King Solomon had directed.",
      "17": "The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan.",
      "18": "Solomon used such great quantities of bronze that its weight could not be determined.",
      "19": "Solomon also made all the furnishings for the Temple of God:\nthe gold altar;\nthe tables for the Bread of the Presence;",
      "20": "the lampstands and their lamps of solid gold, to burn in front of the Most Holy Place as prescribed;",
      "21": "the flower decorations, lamps, and tongs—all of the purest gold;",

      "2": "Solomon then summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of tribes—the leaders of the ancestral families of Israel. They were to bring the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant to the Temple from its location in the City of David, also known as Zion.",
      "3": "So all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the annual Festival of Shelters, which is held in early autumn.",
      "4": "When all the elders of Israel arrived, the Levites picked up the Ark.",
      "5": "The priests and Levites brought up the Ark along with the special tent and all the sacred items that had been in it.",
      "6": "There, before the Ark, King Solomon and the entire community of Israel sacrificed so many sheep, goats, and cattle that no one could keep count!",
      "7": "Then the priests carried the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant into the inner sanctuary of the Temple—the Most Holy Place—and placed it beneath the wings of the cherubim.",
      "8": "The cherubim spread their wings over the Ark, forming a canopy over the Ark and its carrying poles.",
      "9": "These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place, which is in front of the Most Holy Place, but not from the outside. They are still there to this day.",
      "10": "Nothing was in the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Mount Sinai, where the Lord made a covenant with the people of Israel when they left Egypt.",
      "11": "Then the priests left the Holy Place. All the priests who were present had purified themselves, whether or not they were on duty that day.",
      "12": "And the Levites who were musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and all their sons and brothers—were dressed in fine linen robes and stood at the east side of the altar playing cymbals, lyres, and harps. They were joined by 120 priests who were playing trumpets.",
      "13": "The trumpeters and singers performed together in unison to praise and give thanks to the Lord. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, they raised their voices and praised the Lord with these words:\n“He is good!\n    His faithful love endures forever!”\nAt that moment a thick cloud filled the Temple of the Lord.",

      "5": "‘From the day I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have never chosen a city among any of the tribes of Israel as the place where a Temple should be built to honor my name. Nor have I chosen a king to lead my people Israel.",
      "6": "But now I have chosen Jerusalem as the place for my name to be honored, and I have chosen David to be king over my people Israel.’”",

      "13": "Now Solomon had made a bronze platform 7 1⁄2 feet long, 7 1⁄2 feet wide, and 4 1⁄2 feet high and had placed it at the center of the Temple’s outer courtyard. He stood on the platform, and then he knelt in front of the entire community of Israel and lifted his hands toward heaven.",
