      "9": "What you learn from them will crown you with grace\n    and be a chain of honor around your neck.",
      "10": "My child, if sinners entice you,\n    turn your back on them!",
      "11": "They may say, “Come and join us.\n    Let’s hide and kill someone!\n    Just for fun, let’s ambush the innocent!",
      "12": "Let’s swallow them alive, like the grave;\n    let’s swallow them whole, like those who go down to the pit of death.",
      "13": "Think of the great things we’ll get!\n    We’ll fill our houses with all the stuff we take.",

      "28": "“When they cry for help, I will not answer.\n    Though they anxiously search for me, they will not find me.",

      "12": "For the Lord corrects those he loves,\n    just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights.",
      "13": "Joyful is the person who finds wisdom,\n    the one who gains understanding.",
      "14": "For wisdom is more profitable than silver,\n    and her wages are better than gold.",
      "15": "Wisdom is more precious than rubies;\n    nothing you desire can compare with her.",

      "5": "Her feet go down to death;\n    her steps lead straight to the grave.",

      "20": "Why be captivated, my son, by an immoral woman,\n    or fondle the breasts of a promiscuous woman?",
      "21": "For the Lord sees clearly what a man does,\n    examining every path he takes.",
      "22": "An evil man is held captive by his own sins;\n    they are ropes that catch and hold him.",
      "23": "He will die for lack of self-control;\n    he will be lost because of his great foolishness."

      "8": "they labor hard all summer,\n    gathering food for the winter.",
      "9": "But you, lazybones, how long will you sleep?\n    When will you wake up?",
      "10": "A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,\n    a little folding of the hands to rest—",
      "11": "then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit;\n    scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.",
      "12": "What are worthless and wicked people like?\n    They are constant liars,",
      "13": "signaling their deceit with a wink of the eye,\n    a nudge of the foot, or the wiggle of fingers.",

      "22": "When you walk, their counsel will lead you.\n    When you sleep, they will protect you.\n    When you wake up, they will advise you.",
      "23": "For their command is a lamp\n    and their instruction a light;\ntheir corrective discipline\n    is the way to life.",
      "24": "It will keep you from the immoral woman,\n    from the smooth tongue of a promiscuous woman.",
      "25": "Don’t lust for her beauty.\n    Don’t let her coy glances seduce you.",
      "26": "For a prostitute will bring you to poverty,\n    but sleeping with another man’s wife will cost you your life.",

      "28": "Can he walk on hot coals\n    and not blister his feet?",
      "29": "So it is with the man who sleeps with another man’s wife.\n    He who embraces her will not go unpunished.",
      "30": "Excuses might be found for a thief\n    who steals because he is starving.",
      "31": "But if he is caught, he must pay back seven times what he stole,\n    even if he has to sell everything in his house.",

      "33": "He will be wounded and disgraced.\n    His shame will never be erased.",
      "34": "For the woman’s jealous husband will be furious,\n    and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.",
