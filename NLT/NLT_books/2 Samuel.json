      "1": "After the death of Saul, David returned from his victory over the Amalekites and spent two days in Ziklag.",
      "2": "On the third day a man arrived from Saul’s army camp. He had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head to show that he was in mourning. He fell to the ground before David in deep respect.",
      "3": "“Where have you come from?” David asked.\n“I escaped from the Israelite camp,” the man replied.",
      "4": "“What happened?” David demanded. “Tell me how the battle went.”\nThe man replied, “Our entire army fled from the battle. Many of the men are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.”",
      "5": "“How do you know Saul and Jonathan are dead?” David demanded of the young man.",
      "6": "The man answered, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear with the enemy chariots and charioteers closing in on him.",
      "7": "When he turned and saw me, he cried out for me to come to him. ‘How can I help?’ I asked him.",
      "8": "“He responded, ‘Who are you?’\n“‘I am an Amalekite,’ I told him.",
      "9": "“Then he begged me, ‘Come over here and put me out of my misery, for I am in terrible pain and want to die.’",
      "10": "“So I killed him,” the Amalekite told David, “for I knew he couldn’t live. Then I took his crown and his armband, and I have brought them here to you, my lord.”",
      "11": "David and his men tore their clothes in sorrow when they heard the news.",
      "12": "They mourned and wept and fasted all day for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the Lord’s army and the nation of Israel, because they had died by the sword that day.",
      "13": "Then David said to the young man who had brought the news, “Where are you from?”\nAnd he replied, “I am a foreigner, an Amalekite, who lives in your land.”",
      "14": "“Why were you not afraid to kill the Lord’s anointed one?” David asked.",
      "15": "Then David said to one of his men, “Kill him!” So the man thrust his sword into the Amalekite and killed him.",
      "16": "“You have condemned yourself,” David said, “for you yourself confessed that you killed the Lord’s anointed one.”",
      "17": "Then David composed a funeral song for Saul and Jonathan,",
      "18": "and he commanded that it be taught to the people of Judah. It is known as the Song of the Bow, and it is recorded in The Book of Jashar.",
      "19": "Your pride and joy, O Israel, lies dead on the hills!\n    Oh, how the mighty heroes have fallen!",
      "20": "Don’t announce the news in Gath,\n    don’t proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon,\nor the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice\n    and the pagans will laugh in triumph.",
      "21": "O mountains of Gilboa,\n    let there be no dew or rain upon you,\n    nor fruitful fields producing offerings of grain.\nFor there the shield of the mighty heroes was defiled;\n    the shield of Saul will no longer be anointed with oil.",
      "22": "The bow of Jonathan was powerful,\n    and the sword of Saul did its mighty work.\nThey shed the blood of their enemies\n    and pierced the bodies of mighty heroes.",
      "23": "How beloved and gracious were Saul and Jonathan!\n    They were together in life and in death.\nThey were swifter than eagles,\n    stronger than lions.",
      "24": "O women of Israel, weep for Saul,\nfor he dressed you in luxurious scarlet clothing,\n    in garments decorated with gold.",
      "25": "Oh, how the mighty heroes have fallen in battle!\n    Jonathan lies dead on the hills.",
      "26": "How I weep for you, my brother Jonathan!\n    Oh, how much I loved you!\nAnd your love for me was deep,\n    deeper than the love of women!",
      "27": "Oh, how the mighty heroes have fallen!\n    Stripped of their weapons, they lie dead."

      "2": "David’s two wives were Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel. So David and his wives",
      "3": "and his men and their families all moved to Judah, and they settled in the villages near Hebron.",
      "4": "Then the men of Judah came to David and anointed him king over the people of Judah.\nWhen David heard that the men of Jabesh-gilead had buried Saul,",
      "5": "he sent them this message: “May the Lord bless you for being so loyal to your master Saul and giving him a decent burial.",
      "6": "May the Lord be loyal to you in return and reward you with his unfailing love! And I, too, will reward you for what you have done.",
      "7": "Now that Saul is dead, I ask you to be my strong and loyal subjects like the people of Judah, who have anointed me as their new king.”",
      "8": "But Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had already gone to Mahanaim with Saul’s son Ishbosheth.",
      "9": "There he proclaimed Ishbosheth king over Gilead, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, the land of the Ashurites, and all the rest of Israel.",
      "10": "Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he became king, and he ruled from Mahanaim for two years. Meanwhile, the people of Judah remained loyal to David.",
      "11": "David made Hebron his capital, and he ruled as king of Judah for seven and a half years.",
      "12": "One day Abner led Ishbosheth’s troops from Mahanaim to Gibeon.",
      "13": "About the same time, Joab son of Zeruiah led David’s troops out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. The two groups sat down there, facing each other from opposite sides of the pool.",
      "14": "Then Abner suggested to Joab, “Let’s have a few of our warriors fight hand to hand here in front of us.”\n“All right,” Joab agreed.",
      "15": "So twelve men were chosen to fight from each side—twelve men of Benjamin representing Ishbosheth son of Saul, and twelve representing David.",
      "16": "Each one grabbed his opponent by the hair and thrust his sword into the other’s side so that all of them died. So this place at Gibeon has been known ever since as the Field of Swords.",
      "17": "A fierce battle followed that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the forces of David.",
      "18": "Joab, Abishai, and Asahel—the three sons of Zeruiah—were among David’s forces that day. Asahel could run like a gazelle,",
      "19": "and he began chasing Abner. He pursued him relentlessly, not stopping for anything.",
      "20": "When Abner looked back and saw him coming, he called out, “Is that you, Asahel?”\n“Yes, it is,” he replied.",
      "21": "“Go fight someone else!” Abner warned. “Take on one of the younger men, and strip him of his weapons.” But Asahel kept right on chasing Abner.",
      "22": "Again Abner shouted to him, “Get away from here! I don’t want to kill you. How could I ever face your brother Joab again?”",
      "23": "But Asahel refused to turn back, so Abner thrust the butt end of his spear through Asahel’s stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He stumbled to the ground and died there. And everyone who came by that spot stopped and stood still when they saw Asahel lying there.",
      "24": "When Joab and Abishai found out what had happened, they set out after Abner. The sun was just going down as they arrived at the hill of Ammah near Giah, along the road to the wilderness of Gibeon.",
      "25": "Abner’s troops from the tribe of Benjamin regrouped there at the top of the hill to take a stand.",
      "26": "Abner shouted down to Joab, “Must we always be killing each other? Don’t you realize that bitterness is the only result? When will you call off your men from chasing their Israelite brothers?”",
      "27": "Then Joab said, “God only knows what would have happened if you hadn’t spoken, for we would have chased you all night if necessary.”",
      "28": "So Joab blew the ram’s horn, and his men stopped chasing the troops of Israel.",
      "29": "All that night Abner and his men retreated through the Jordan Valley. They crossed the Jordan River, traveling all through the morning, and didn’t stop until they arrived at Mahanaim.",
      "30": "Meanwhile, Joab and his men also returned home. When Joab counted his casualties, he discovered that only 19 men were missing in addition to Asahel.",
      "31": "But 360 of Abner’s men had been killed, all from the tribe of Benjamin.",
      "32": "Joab and his men took Asahel’s body to Bethlehem and buried him there in his father’s tomb. Then they traveled all night and reached Hebron at daybreak."

      "1": "That was the beginning of a long war between those who were loyal to Saul and those loyal to David. As time passed David became stronger and stronger, while Saul’s dynasty became weaker and weaker.",
      "2": "These are the sons who were born to David in Hebron:\nThe oldest was Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam from Jezreel.",
      "3": "The second was Daniel, whose mother was Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel.\nThe third was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.",
      "4": "The fourth was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith.\nThe fifth was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital.",
      "5": "The sixth was Ithream, whose mother was Eglah, David’s wife.\nThese sons were all born to David in Hebron.",
      "6": "As the war between the house of Saul and the house of David went on, Abner became a powerful leader among those loyal to Saul.",
      "7": "One day Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, accused Abner of sleeping with one of his father’s concubines, a woman named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah.",
      "8": "Abner was furious. “Am I some Judean dog to be kicked around like this?” he shouted. “After all I have done for your father, Saul, and his family and friends by not handing you over to David, is this my reward—that you find fault with me about this woman?",
      "9": "May God strike me and even kill me if I don’t do everything I can to help David get what the Lord has promised him!",
      "10": "I’m going to take Saul’s kingdom and give it to David. I will establish the throne of David over Israel as well as Judah, all the way from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south.”",
      "11": "Ishbosheth didn’t dare say another word because he was afraid of what Abner might do.",
      "12": "Then Abner sent messengers to David, saying, “Doesn’t the entire land belong to you? Make a solemn pact with me, and I will help turn over all of Israel to you.”",
      "13": "“All right,” David replied, “but I will not negotiate with you unless you bring back my wife Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come.”",
      "14": "David then sent this message to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son: “Give me back my wife Michal, for I bought her with the lives of 100 Philistines.”",
      "15": "So Ishbosheth took Michal away from her husband, Palti son of Laish.",
      "16": "Palti followed along behind her as far as Bahurim, weeping as he went. Then Abner told him, “Go back home!” So Palti returned.",
      "17": "Meanwhile, Abner had consulted with the elders of Israel. “For some time now,” he told them, “you have wanted to make David your king.",
      "18": "Now is the time! For the Lord has said, ‘I have chosen David to save my people Israel from the hands of the Philistines and from all their other enemies.’”",
      "19": "Abner also spoke with the men of Benjamin. Then he went to Hebron to tell David that all the people of Israel and Benjamin had agreed to support him.",
      "20": "When Abner and twenty of his men came to Hebron, David entertained them with a great feast.",
      "21": "Then Abner said to David, “Let me go and call an assembly of all Israel to support my lord the king. They will make a covenant with you to make you their king, and you will rule over everything your heart desires.” So David sent Abner safely on his way.",
      "22": "But just after David had sent Abner away in safety, Joab and some of David’s troops returned from a raid, bringing much plunder with them.",
      "23": "When Joab arrived, he was told that Abner had just been there visiting the king and had been sent away in safety.",
      "24": "Joab rushed to the king and demanded, “What have you done? What do you mean by letting Abner get away?",
      "25": "You know perfectly well that he came to spy on you and find out everything you’re doing!”",
      "26": "Joab then left David and sent messengers to catch up with Abner, asking him to return. They found him at the well of Sirah and brought him back, though David knew nothing about it.",
      "27": "When Abner arrived back at Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gateway as if to speak with him privately. But then he stabbed Abner in the stomach and killed him in revenge for killing his brother Asahel.",
      "28": "When David heard about it, he declared, “I vow by the Lord that I and my kingdom are forever innocent of this crime against Abner son of Ner.",
      "29": "Joab and his family are the guilty ones. May the family of Joab be cursed in every generation with a man who has open sores or leprosy or who walks on crutches or dies by the sword or begs for food!”",
      "30": "So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because Abner had killed their brother Asahel at the battle of Gibeon.",
      "31": "Then David said to Joab and all those who were with him, “Tear your clothes and put on burlap. Mourn for Abner.” And King David himself walked behind the procession to the grave.",
      "32": "They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king and all the people wept at his graveside.",
      "33": "Then the king sang this funeral song for Abner:\n“Should Abner have died as fools die?",
      "34": "Your hands were not bound;\n    your feet were not chained.\nNo, you were murdered—\n    the victim of a wicked plot.”\nAll the people wept again for Abner.",
      "35": "David had refused to eat anything on the day of the funeral, and now everyone begged him to eat. But David had made a vow, saying, “May God strike me and even kill me if I eat anything before sundown.”",
      "36": "This pleased the people very much. In fact, everything the king did pleased them!",
      "37": "So everyone in Judah and all Israel understood that David was not responsible for Abner’s murder.",
      "38": "Then King David said to his officials, “Don’t you realize that a great commander has fallen today in Israel?",
      "39": "And even though I am the anointed king, these two sons of Zeruiah—Joab and Abishai—are too strong for me to control. So may the Lord repay these evil men for their evil deeds.”"

      "1": "When Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, heard about Abner’s death at Hebron, he lost all courage, and all Israel became paralyzed with fear.",
      "2": "Now there were two brothers, Baanah and Recab, who were captains of Ishbosheth’s raiding parties. They were sons of Rimmon, a member of the tribe of Benjamin who lived in Beeroth. The town of Beeroth is now part of Benjamin’s territory",
      "3": "because the original people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim, where they still live as foreigners.",
      "4": "(Saul’s son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth, who was crippled as a child. He was five years old when the report came from Jezreel that Saul and Jonathan had been killed in battle. When the child’s nurse heard the news, she picked him up and fled. But as she hurried away, she dropped him, and he became crippled.)",
      "5": "One day Recab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth, went to Ishbosheth’s house around noon as he was taking his midday rest.",
      "6": "The doorkeeper, who had been sifting wheat, became drowsy and fell asleep. So Recab and Baanah slipped past her.",
      "7": "They went into the house and found Ishbosheth sleeping on his bed. They struck and killed him and cut off his head. Then, taking his head with them, they fled across the Jordan Valley through the night.",
      "8": "When they arrived at Hebron, they presented Ishbosheth’s head to David. “Look!” they exclaimed to the king. “Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul who tried to kill you. Today the Lord has given my lord the king revenge on Saul and his entire family!”",
      "9": "But David said to Recab and Baanah, “The Lord, who saves me from all my enemies, is my witness.",
      "10": "Someone once told me, ‘Saul is dead,’ thinking he was bringing me good news. But I seized him and killed him at Ziklag. That’s the reward I gave him for his news!",
      "11": "How much more should I reward evil men who have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed? Shouldn’t I hold you responsible for his blood and rid the earth of you?”",
      "12": "So David ordered his young men to kill them, and they did. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies beside the pool in Hebron. Then they took Ishbosheth’s head and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron."

    "5": {
      "1": "Then all the tribes of Israel went to David at Hebron and told him, “We are your own flesh and blood.",

      "3": "So there at Hebron, King David made a covenant before the Lord with all the elders of Israel. And they anointed him king of Israel.",
      "4": "David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in all.",
      "5": "He had reigned over Judah from Hebron for seven years and six months, and from Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years.",
      "6": "David then led his men to Jerusalem to fight against the Jebusites, the original inhabitants of the land who were living there. The Jebusites taunted David, saying, “You’ll never get in here! Even the blind and lame could keep you out!” For the Jebusites thought they were safe.",
      "7": "But David captured the fortress of Zion, which is now called the City of David.",
      "8": "On the day of the attack, David said to his troops, “I hate those ‘lame’ and ‘blind’ Jebusites. Whoever attacks them should strike by going into the city through the water tunnel.” That is the origin of the saying, “The blind and the lame may not enter the house.”",
      "9": "So David made the fortress his home, and he called it the City of David. He extended the city, starting at the supporting terraces and working inward.",
      "10": "And David became more and more powerful, because the Lord God of Heaven’s Armies was with him.",
      "11": "Then King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built David a palace.",
      "12": "And David realized that the Lord had confirmed him as king over Israel and had blessed his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.",
      "13": "After moving from Hebron to Jerusalem, David married more concubines and wives, and they had more sons and daughters.",
      "14": "These are the names of David’s sons who were born in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,",
      "15": "Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,",

      "17": "When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of Israel, they mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David was told they were coming, so he went into the stronghold.",
      "18": "The Philistines arrived and spread out across the valley of Rephaim.",
      "19": "So David asked the Lord, “Should I go out to fight the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?”\nThe Lord replied to David, “Yes, go ahead. I will certainly hand them over to you.”",
      "20": "So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there. “The Lord did it!” David exclaimed. “He burst through my enemies like a raging flood!” So he named that place Baal-perazim (which means “the Lord who bursts through”).",
      "21": "The Philistines had abandoned their idols there, so David and his men confiscated them.",
      "22": "But after a while the Philistines returned and again spread out across the valley of Rephaim.",
      "23": "And again David asked the Lord what to do. “Do not attack them straight on,” the Lord replied. “Instead, circle around behind and attack them near the poplar trees.",
      "24": "When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the poplar trees, be on the alert! That will be the signal that the Lord is moving ahead of you to strike down the Philistine army.”",

      "10": "So David decided not to move the Ark of the Lord into the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-edom of Gath.",
      "11": "The Ark of the Lord remained there in Obed-edom’s house for three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and his entire household.",
      "12": "Then King David was told, “The Lord has blessed Obed-edom’s household and everything he has because of the Ark of God.” So David went there and brought the Ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the City of David with a great celebration.",

      "15": "So David and all the people of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord with shouts of joy and the blowing of rams’ horns.",
      "16": "But as the Ark of the Lord entered the City of David, Michal, the daughter of Saul, looked down from her window. When she saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord, she was filled with contempt for him.",
      "17": "They brought the Ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the special tent David had prepared for it. And David sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord.",
      "18": "When he had finished his sacrifices, David blessed the people in the name of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.",
      "19": "Then he gave to every Israelite man and woman in the crowd a loaf of bread, a cake of dates, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people returned to their homes.",

      "15": "“I have come to plead with my lord the king because people have threatened me. I said to myself, ‘Perhaps the king will listen to me",
      "16": "and rescue us from those who would cut us off from the inheritance God has given us.",
      "17": "Yes, my lord the king will give us peace of mind again.’ I know that you are like an angel of God in discerning good from evil. May the Lord your God be with you.”",
      "18": "“I must know one thing,” the king replied, “and tell me the truth.”\n“Yes, my lord the king,” she responded.",
      "19": "“Did Joab put you up to this?”\nAnd the woman replied, “My lord the king, how can I deny it? Nobody can hide anything from you. Yes, Joab sent me and told me what to say.",
      "20": "He did it to place the matter before you in a different light. But you are as wise as an angel of God, and you understand everything that happens among us!”",
      "21": "So the king sent for Joab and told him, “All right, go and bring back the young man Absalom.”",
      "22": "Joab bowed with his face to the ground in deep respect and said, “At last I know that I have gained your approval, my lord the king, for you have granted me this request!”",
      "23": "Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.",
      "24": "But the king gave this order: “Absalom may go to his own house, but he must never come into my presence.” So Absalom did not see the king.",
      "25": "Now Absalom was praised as the most handsome man in all Israel. He was flawless from head to foot.",
      "26": "He cut his hair only once a year, and then only because it was so heavy. When he weighed it out, it came to five pounds!",
      "27": "He had three sons and one daughter. His daughter’s name was Tamar, and she was very beautiful.",
      "28": "Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years, but he never got to see the king.",

      "30": "So Absalom said to his servants, “Go and set fire to Joab’s barley field, the field next to mine.” So they set his field on fire, as Absalom had commanded.",
      "31": "Then Joab came to Absalom at his house and demanded, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?”",
      "32": "And Absalom replied, “Because I wanted you to ask the king why he brought me back from Geshur if he didn’t intend to see me. I might as well have stayed there. Let me see the king; if he finds me guilty of anything, then let him kill me.”",
      "33": "So Joab told the king what Absalom had said. Then at last David summoned Absalom, who came and bowed low before the king, and the king kissed him."

      "3": "Then Absalom would say, “You’ve really got a strong case here! It’s too bad the king doesn’t have anyone to hear it.",
      "4": "I wish I were the judge. Then everyone could bring their cases to me for judgment, and I would give them justice!”",
      "5": "When people tried to bow before him, Absalom wouldn’t let them. Instead, he took them by the hand and kissed them.",
      "6": "Absalom did this with everyone who came to the king for judgment, and so he stole the hearts of all the people of Israel.",
      "7": "After four years, Absalom said to the king, “Let me go to Hebron to offer a sacrifice to the Lord and fulfill a vow I made to him.",
      "8": "For while your servant was at Geshur in Aram, I promised to sacrifice to the Lord in Hebron if he would bring me back to Jerusalem.”",
      "9": "“All right,” the king told him. “Go and fulfill your vow.”\nSo Absalom went to Hebron.",

      "12": "While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel, one of David’s counselors who lived in Giloh. Soon many others also joined Absalom, and the conspiracy gained momentum.",
      "13": "A messenger soon arrived in Jerusalem to tell David, “All Israel has joined Absalom in a conspiracy against you!”",
      "14": "“Then we must flee at once, or it will be too late!” David urged his men. “Hurry! If we get out of the city before Absalom arrives, both we and the city of Jerusalem will be spared from disaster.”",
      "15": "“We are with you,” his advisers replied. “Do what you think is best.”",

      "17": "The king and all his people set out on foot, pausing at the last house",
      "18": "to let all the king’s men move past to lead the way. There were 600 men from Gath who had come with David, along with the king’s bodyguard.",
      "19": "Then the king turned and said to Ittai, a leader of the men from Gath, “Why are you coming with us? Go on back to King Absalom, for you are a guest in Israel, a foreigner in exile.",
      "20": "You arrived only recently, and should I force you today to wander with us? I don’t even know where we will go. Go on back and take your kinsmen with you, and may the Lord show you his unfailing love and faithfulness.”",

      "24": "Zadok and all the Levites also came along, carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God. They set down the Ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until everyone had passed out of the city.",
      "25": "Then the king instructed Zadok to take the Ark of God back into the city. “If the Lord sees fit,” David said, “he will bring me back to see the Ark and the Tabernacle again.",
      "26": "But if he is through with me, then let him do what seems best to him.”",
      "27": "The king also told Zadok the priest, “Look, here is my plan. You and Abiathar should return quietly to the city with your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan.",
      "28": "I will stop at the shallows of the Jordan River and wait there for a report from you.”",
      "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of God back to the city and stayed there.",
      "30": "David walked up the road to the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went. His head was covered and his feet were bare as a sign of mourning. And the people who were with him covered their heads and wept as they climbed the hill.",
      "31": "When someone told David that his adviser Ahithophel was now backing Absalom, David prayed, “O Lord, let Ahithophel give Absalom foolish advice!”",
      "32": "When David reached the summit of the Mount of Olives where people worshiped God, Hushai the Arkite was waiting there for him. Hushai had torn his clothing and put dirt on his head as a sign of mourning.",

      "2": "“What are these for?” the king asked Ziba.\nZiba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s people to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat. The wine is for those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”",
      "3": "“And where is Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson?” the king asked him.\n“He stayed in Jerusalem,” Ziba replied. “He said, ‘Today I will get back the kingdom of my grandfather Saul.’”",
      "4": "“In that case,” the king told Ziba, “I give you everything Mephibosheth owns.”\n“I bow before you,” Ziba replied. “May I always be pleasing to you, my lord the king.”",

      "9": "“Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?” Abishai son of Zeruiah demanded. “Let me go over and cut off his head!”",
      "10": "“No!” the king said. “Who asked your opinion, you sons of Zeruiah! If the Lord has told him to curse me, who are you to stop him?”",
      "11": "Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “My own son is trying to kill me. Doesn’t this relative of Saul have even more reason to do so? Leave him alone and let him curse, for the Lord has told him to do it.",
      "12": "And perhaps the Lord will see that I am being wronged and will bless me because of these curses today.”",
      "13": "So David and his men continued down the road, and Shimei kept pace with them on a nearby hillside, cursing and throwing stones and dirt at David.",
      "14": "The king and all who were with him grew weary along the way, so they rested when they reached the Jordan River.",
      "15": "Meanwhile, Absalom and all the army of Israel arrived at Jerusalem, accompanied by Ahithophel.",

      "17": "“Is this the way you treat your friend David?” Absalom asked him. “Why aren’t you with him?”",
      "18": "“I’m here because I belong to the man who is chosen by the Lord and by all the men of Israel,” Hushai replied.",
      "19": "“And anyway, why shouldn’t I serve you? Just as I was your father’s adviser, now I will be your adviser!”",

      "8": "You know your father and his men; they are mighty warriors. Right now they are as enraged as a mother bear who has been robbed of her cubs. And remember that your father is an experienced man of war. He won’t be spending the night among the troops.",
      "9": "He has probably already hidden in some pit or cave. And when he comes out and attacks and a few of your men fall, there will be panic among your troops, and the word will spread that Absalom’s men are being slaughtered.",
      "10": "Then even the bravest soldiers, though they have the heart of a lion, will be paralyzed with fear. For all Israel knows what a mighty warrior your father is and how courageous his men are.",
      "11": "“I recommend that you mobilize the entire army of Israel, bringing them from as far away as Dan in the north and Beersheba in the south. That way you will have an army as numerous as the sand on the seashore. And I advise that you personally lead the troops.",
      "12": "When we find David, we’ll fall on him like dew that falls on the ground. Then neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.",
      "13": "And if David were to escape into some town, you will have all Israel there at your command. Then we can take ropes and drag the walls of the town into the nearest valley until every stone is torn down.”",
      "14": "Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “Hushai’s advice is better than Ahithophel’s.” For the Lord had determined to defeat the counsel of Ahithophel, which really was the better plan, so that he could bring disaster on Absalom!",
      "15": "Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, what Ahithophel had said to Absalom and the elders of Israel and what he himself had advised instead.",

      "19": "The man’s wife put a cloth over the top of the well and scattered grain on it to dry in the sun; so no one suspected they were there.",
      "20": "When Absalom’s men arrived, they asked her, “Have you seen Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”\nThe woman replied, “They were here, but they crossed over the brook.” Absalom’s men looked for them without success and returned to Jerusalem.",

      "25": "Absalom had appointed Amasa as commander of his army, replacing Joab, who had been commander under David. (Amasa was Joab’s cousin. His father was Jether, an Ishmaelite. His mother, Abigail daughter of Nahash, was the sister of Joab’s mother, Zeruiah.)",
      "26": "Absalom and the Israelite army set up camp in the land of Gilead.",

      "3": "But his men objected strongly. “You must not go,” they urged. “If we have to turn and run—and even if half of us die—it will make no difference to Absalom’s troops; they will be looking only for you. You are worth 10,000 of us, and it is better that you stay here in the town and send help if we need it.”",
      "4": "“If you think that’s the best plan, I’ll do it,” the king answered. So he stood alongside the gate of the town as all the troops marched out in groups of hundreds and of thousands.",

      "10": "One of David’s men saw what had happened and told Joab, “I saw Absalom dangling from a great tree.”",
      "11": "“What?” Joab demanded. “You saw him there and didn’t kill him? I would have rewarded you with ten pieces of silver and a hero’s belt!”",
      "12": "“I would not kill the king’s son for even a thousand pieces of silver,” the man replied to Joab. “We all heard the king say to you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘For my sake, please spare young Absalom.’",
      "13": "And if I had betrayed the king by killing his son—and the king would certainly find out who did it—you yourself would be the first to abandon me.”",
      "14": "“Enough of this nonsense,” Joab said. Then he took three daggers and plunged them into Absalom’s heart as he dangled, still alive, in the great tree.",
      "15": "Ten of Joab’s young armor bearers then surrounded Absalom and killed him.",
      "16": "Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and his men returned from chasing the army of Israel.",
      "17": "They threw Absalom’s body into a deep pit in the forest and piled a great heap of stones over it. And all Israel fled to their homes.",
      "18": "During his lifetime, Absalom had built a monument to himself in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to carry on my name.” He named the monument after himself, and it is known as Absalom’s Monument to this day.",
      "19": "Then Zadok’s son Ahimaaz said, “Let me run to the king with the good news that the Lord has rescued him from his enemies.”",
      "20": "“No,” Joab told him, “it wouldn’t be good news to the king that his son is dead. You can be my messenger another time, but not today.”",
      "21": "Then Joab said to a man from Ethiopia, “Go tell the king what you have seen.” The man bowed and ran off.",
      "22": "But Ahimaaz continued to plead with Joab, “Whatever happens, please let me go, too.”\n“Why should you go, my son?” Joab replied. “There will be no reward for your news.”",
      "23": "“Yes, but let me go anyway,” he begged.\nJoab finally said, “All right, go ahead.” So Ahimaaz took the less demanding route by way of the plain and ran to Mahanaim ahead of the Ethiopian.",
      "24": "While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town, the watchman climbed to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked, he saw a lone man running toward them.",

      "26": "the watchman saw another man running toward them. He shouted down, “Here comes another one!”\nThe king replied, “He also will have news.”",
      "27": "“The first man runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok,” the watchman said.\n“He is a good man and comes with good news,” the king replied.",
      "28": "Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, “Everything is all right!” He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Praise to the Lord your God, who has handed over the rebels who dared to stand against my lord the king.”",

      "32": "“What about young Absalom?” the king demanded. “Is he all right?”\nAnd the Ethiopian replied, “May all of your enemies, my lord the king, both now and in the future, share the fate of that young man!”",
      "33": "The king was overcome with emotion. He went up to the room over the gateway and burst into tears. And as he went, he cried, “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you! O Absalom, my son, my son.”"

Weren’t we the first to speak of bringing him back to be our king again?” The argument continued back and forth, and the men of Judah spoke even more harshly than the men of Israel."

      "23": "I will give it all to you, Your Majesty, and may the Lord your God accept your sacrifice.”",
      "24": "But the king replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on buying it, for I will not present burnt offerings to the Lord my God that have cost me nothing.” So David paid him fifty pieces of silver for the threshing floor and the oxen.",
      "25": "David built an altar there to the Lord and sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings. And the Lord answered his prayer for the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped."
