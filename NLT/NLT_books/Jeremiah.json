      "1": "These are the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests from the town of Anathoth in the land of Benjamin.",
      "2": "The Lord first gave messages to Jeremiah during the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah.",
      "3": "The Lord’s messages continued throughout the reign of King Jehoiakim, Josiah’s son, until the eleventh year of the reign of King Zedekiah, another of Josiah’s sons. In August of that eleventh year the people of Jerusalem were taken away as captives.",
      "4": "The Lord gave me this message:",
      "5": "“I knew you before I formed you in your mother’s womb.\n    Before you were born I set you apart\n    and appointed you as my prophet to the nations.”",
      "6": "“O Sovereign Lord,” I said, “I can’t speak for you! I’m too young!”",
      "7": "The Lord replied, “Don’t say, ‘I’m too young,’ for you must go wherever I send you and say whatever I tell you.",
      "8": "And don’t be afraid of the people, for I will be with you and will protect you. I, the Lord, have spoken!”",
      "9": "Then the Lord reached out and touched my mouth and said,\n“Look, I have put my words in your mouth!",
      "10": "Today I appoint you to stand up\n    against nations and kingdoms.\nSome you must uproot and tear down,\n    destroy and overthrow.\nOthers you must build up\n    and plant.”",
      "11": "Then the Lord said to me, “Look, Jeremiah! What do you see?”\nAnd I replied, “I see a branch from an almond tree.”",
      "12": "And the Lord said, “That’s right, and it means that I am watching, and I will certainly carry out all my plans.”",
      "13": "Then the Lord spoke to me again and asked, “What do you see now?”\nAnd I replied, “I see a pot of boiling water, spilling from the north.”",
      "14": "“Yes,” the Lord said, “for terror from the north will boil out on the people of this land.",
      "15": "Listen! I am calling the armies of the kingdoms of the north to come to Jerusalem. I, the Lord, have spoken!\n“They will set their thrones\n    at the gates of the city.\nThey will attack its walls\n    and all the other towns of Judah.",
      "16": "I will pronounce judgment\n    on my people for all their evil—\nfor deserting me and burning incense to other gods.\n    Yes, they worship idols made with their own hands!",
      "17": "“Get up and prepare for action.\n    Go out and tell them everything I tell you to say.\nDo not be afraid of them,\n    or I will make you look foolish in front of them.",
      "18": "For see, today I have made you strong\n    like a fortified city that cannot be captured,\n    like an iron pillar or a bronze wall.\nYou will stand against the whole land—\n    the kings, officials, priests, and people of Judah.",
      "19": "They will fight you, but they will fail.\n    For I am with you, and I will take care of you.\n    I, the Lord, have spoken!”"

      "3": "In those days Israel was holy to the Lord,\n    the first of his children.\nAll who harmed his people were declared guilty,\n    and disaster fell on them.\n    I, the Lord, have spoken!”",
      "4": "Listen to the word of the Lord, people of Jacob—all you families of Israel!",
      "5": "This is what the Lord says:\n“What did your ancestors find wrong with me\n    that led them to stray so far from me?\nThey worshiped worthless idols,\n    only to become worthless themselves.",
      "6": "They did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord\n    who brought us safely out of Egypt\nand led us through the barren wilderness—\n    a land of deserts and pits,\na land of drought and death,\n    where no one lives or even travels?’",
      "7": "“And when I brought you into a fruitful land\n    to enjoy its bounty and goodness,\nyou defiled my land and\n    corrupted the possession I had promised you.",
      "8": "The priests did not ask,\n    ‘Where is the Lord?’\nThose who taught my word ignored me,\n    the rulers turned against me,\nand the prophets spoke in the name of Baal,\n    wasting their time on worthless idols.",
      "9": "Therefore, I will bring my case against you,”\n    says the Lord.\n“I will even bring charges against your children’s children\n    in the years to come.",
      "10": "“Go west and look in the land of Cyprus;\n    go east and search through the land of Kedar.\nHas anyone ever heard of anything\n    as strange as this?",
      "11": "Has any nation ever traded its gods for new ones,\n    even though they are not gods at all?\nYet my people have exchanged their glorious God\n    for worthless idols!",
      "12": "The heavens are shocked at such a thing\n    and shrink back in horror and dismay,”\n    says the Lord.",
      "13": "“For my people have done two evil things:\nThey have abandoned me—\n    the fountain of living water.\nAnd they have dug for themselves cracked cisterns\n    that can hold no water at all!",

      "16": "Egyptians, marching from their cities of Memphis and Tahpanhes,\n    have destroyed Israel’s glory and power.",
      "17": "And you have brought this upon yourselves\n    by rebelling against the Lord your God,\n    even though he was leading you on the way!",
      "18": "“What have you gained by your alliances with Egypt\n    and your covenants with Assyria?\nWhat good to you are the streams of the Nile\n    or the waters of the Euphrates River?",
      "19": "Your wickedness will bring its own punishment.\n    Your turning from me will shame you.\nYou will see what an evil, bitter thing it is\n    to abandon the Lord your God and not to fear him.\n    I, the Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, have spoken!",
      "20": "“Long ago I broke the yoke that oppressed you\n    and tore away the chains of your slavery,\nbut still you said,\n    ‘I will not serve you.’\nOn every hill and under every green tree,\n    you have prostituted yourselves by bowing down to idols.",
      "21": "But I was the one who planted you,\n    choosing a vine of the purest stock—the very best.\n    How did you grow into this corrupt wild vine?",
      "22": "No amount of soap or lye can make you clean.\n    I still see the stain of your guilt.\n    I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!",
      "23": "“You say, ‘That’s not true!\n    I haven’t worshiped the images of Baal!’\nBut how can you say that?\n    Go and look in any valley in the land!\nFace the awful sins you have done.\n    You are like a restless female camel\n    desperately searching for a mate.",
      "24": "You are like a wild donkey,\n    sniffing the wind at mating time.\nWho can restrain her lust?\n    Those who desire her don’t need to search,\n    for she goes running to them!",
      "25": "When will you stop running?\n    When will you stop panting after other gods?\nBut you say, ‘Save your breath.\n    I’m in love with these foreign gods,\n    and I can’t stop loving them now!’",
      "26": "“Israel is like a thief\n    who feels shame only when he gets caught.\nThey, their kings, officials, priests, and prophets—\n    all are alike in this.",
      "27": "To an image carved from a piece of wood they say,\n    ‘You are my father.’\nTo an idol chiseled from a block of stone they say,\n    ‘You are my mother.’\nThey turn their backs on me,\n    but in times of trouble they cry out to me,\n    ‘Come and save us!’",
      "28": "But why not call on these gods you have made?\n    When trouble comes, let them save you if they can!\nFor you have as many gods\n    as there are towns in Judah.",
      "29": "Why do you accuse me of doing wrong?\n    You are the ones who have rebelled,”\n    says the Lord.",
      "30": "“I have punished your children,\n    but they did not respond to my discipline.\nYou yourselves have killed your prophets\n    as a lion kills its prey.",
      "31": "“O my people, listen to the words of the Lord!\n    Have I been like a desert to Israel?\n    Have I been to them a land of darkness?\nWhy then do my people say, ‘At last we are free from God!\n    We don’t need him anymore!’",
      "32": "Does a young woman forget her jewelry,\n    or a bride her wedding dress?\nYet for years on end\n    my people have forgotten me.",
      "33": "“How you plot and scheme to win your lovers.\n    Even an experienced prostitute could learn from you!",
      "34": "Your clothing is stained with the blood of the innocent and the poor,\n    though you didn’t catch them breaking into your houses!",
      "35": "And yet you say,\n‘I have done nothing wrong.\n    Surely God isn’t angry with me!’\nBut now I will punish you severely\n    because you claim you have not sinned.",
      "36": "First here, then there—\n    you flit from one ally to another asking for help.\nBut your new friends in Egypt will let you down,\n    just as Assyria did before.",
      "37": "In despair, you will be led into exile\n    with your hands on your heads,\nfor the Lord has rejected the nations you trust.\n    They will not help you at all."

      "1": "“If a man divorces a woman\n    and she goes and marries someone else,\nhe will not take her back again,\n    for that would surely corrupt the land.\nBut you have prostituted yourself with many lovers,\n    so why are you trying to come back to me?”\n    says the Lord.",
      "2": "“Look at the shrines on every hilltop.\n    Is there any place you have not been defiled\n    by your adultery with other gods?\nYou sit like a prostitute beside the road waiting for a customer.\n    You sit alone like a nomad in the desert.\nYou have polluted the land with your prostitution\n    and your wickedness.",
      "3": "That’s why even the spring rains have failed.\n    For you are a brazen prostitute and completely shameless.",

      "5": "Surely you won’t be angry forever!\n    Surely you can forget about it!’\nSo you talk,\n    but you keep on doing all the evil you can.”",
      "6": "During the reign of King Josiah, the Lord said to me, “Have you seen what fickle Israel has done? Like a wife who commits adultery, Israel has worshiped other gods on every hill and under every green tree.",
      "7": "I thought, ‘After she has done all this, she will return to me.’ But she did not return, and her faithless sister Judah saw this.",
      "8": "She saw that I divorced faithless Israel because of her adultery. But that treacherous sister Judah had no fear, and now she, too, has left me and given herself to prostitution.",
      "9": "Israel treated it all so lightly—she thought nothing of committing adultery by worshiping idols made of wood and stone. So now the land has been polluted.",
      "10": "But despite all this, her faithless sister Judah has never sincerely returned to me. She has only pretended to be sorry. I, the Lord, have spoken!”",
      "11": "Then the Lord said to me, “Even faithless Israel is less guilty than treacherous Judah!",
      "12": "Therefore, go and give this message to Israel. This is what the Lord says:\n“O Israel, my faithless people,\n    come home to me again,\nfor I am merciful.\n    I will not be angry with you forever.",
      "13": "Only acknowledge your guilt.\n    Admit that you rebelled against the Lord your God\nand committed adultery against him\n    by worshiping idols under every green tree.\nConfess that you refused to listen to my voice.\n    I, the Lord, have spoken!",
      "14": "“Return home, you wayward children,”\n    says the Lord,\n    “for I am your master.\nI will bring you back to the land of Israel—\n    one from this town and two from that family—\n    from wherever you are scattered.",
      "15": "And I will give you shepherds after my own heart,\n    who will guide you with knowledge and understanding.",
      "16": "“And when your land is once more filled with people,” says the Lord, “you will no longer wish for ‘the good old days’ when you possessed the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant. You will not miss those days or even remember them, and there will be no need to rebuild the Ark.",
      "17": "In that day Jerusalem will be known as ‘The Throne of the Lord.’ All nations will come there to honor the Lord. They will no longer stubbornly follow their own evil desires.",
      "18": "In those days the people of Judah and Israel will return together from exile in the north. They will return to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance forever.",
      "19": "“I thought to myself,\n    ‘I would love to treat you as my own children!’\nI wanted nothing more than to give you this beautiful land—\n    the finest possession in the world.\nI looked forward to your calling me ‘Father,’\n    and I wanted you never to turn from me.",
      "20": "But you have been unfaithful to me, you people of Israel!\n    You have been like a faithless wife who leaves her husband.\n    I, the Lord, have spoken.”",
      "21": "Voices are heard high on the windswept mountains,\n    the weeping and pleading of Israel’s people.\nFor they have chosen crooked paths\n    and have forgotten the Lord their God.",
      "22": "“My wayward children,” says the Lord,\n    “come back to me, and I will heal your wayward hearts.”\n“Yes, we’re coming,” the people reply,\n    “for you are the Lord our God.",
      "23": "Our worship of idols on the hills\n    and our religious orgies on the mountains\n    are a delusion.\nOnly in the Lord our God\n    will Israel ever find salvation.",
      "24": "From childhood we have watched\n    as everything our ancestors worked for—\ntheir flocks and herds, their sons and daughters—\n    was squandered on a delusion.",
