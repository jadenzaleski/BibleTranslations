      "1": "The Lord gave this message to Micah of Moresheth during the years when Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah. The visions he saw concerned both Samaria and Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Attention! Let all the people of the world listen!\n    Let the earth and everything in it hear.\nThe Sovereign Lord is making accusations against you;\n    the Lord speaks from his holy Temple.",
      "3": "Look! The Lord is coming!\n    He leaves his throne in heaven\n    and tramples the heights of the earth.",
      "4": "The mountains melt beneath his feet\n    and flow into the valleys\nlike wax in a fire,\n    like water pouring down a hill.",
      "5": "And why is this happening?\n    Because of the rebellion of Israel—\n    yes, the sins of the whole nation.\nWho is to blame for Israel’s rebellion?\n    Samaria, its capital city!\nWhere is the center of idolatry in Judah?\n    In Jerusalem, its capital!",
      "6": "“So I, the Lord, will make the city of Samaria\n    a heap of ruins.\nHer streets will be plowed up\n    for planting vineyards.\nI will roll the stones of her walls into the valley below,\n    exposing her foundations.",
      "7": "All her carved images will be smashed.\n    All her sacred treasures will be burned.\nThese things were bought with the money\n    earned by her prostitution,\nand they will now be carried away\n    to pay prostitutes elsewhere.”",
      "8": "Therefore, I will mourn and lament.\n    I will walk around barefoot and naked.\nI will howl like a jackal\n    and moan like an owl.",
      "9": "For my people’s wound\n    is too deep to heal.\nIt has reached into Judah,\n    even to the gates of Jerusalem.",
      "10": "Don’t tell our enemies in Gath;\n    don’t weep at all.\nYou people in Beth-leaphrah,\n    roll in the dust to show your despair.",
      "11": "You people in Shaphir,\n    go as captives into exile—naked and ashamed.\nThe people of Zaanan\n    dare not come outside their walls.\nThe people of Beth-ezel mourn,\n    for their house has no support.",
      "12": "The people of Maroth anxiously wait for relief,\n    but only bitterness awaits them\nas the Lord’s judgment reaches\n    even to the gates of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Harness your chariot horses and flee,\n    you people of Lachish.\nYou were the first city in Judah\n    to follow Israel in her rebellion,\n    and you led Jerusalem into sin.",
      "14": "Send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath;\n    there is no hope of saving it.\nThe town of Aczib\n    has deceived the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "O people of Mareshah,\n    I will bring a conqueror to capture your town.\nAnd the leaders of Israel\n    will go to Adullam.",
      "16": "Oh, people of Judah, shave your heads in sorrow,\n    for the children you love will be snatched away.\nMake yourselves as bald as a vulture,\n    for your little ones will be exiled to distant lands."

    "2": {
      "1": "What sorrow awaits you who lie awake at night,\n    thinking up evil plans.\nYou rise at dawn and hurry to carry them out,\n    simply because you have the power to do so.",
      "2": "When you want a piece of land,\n    you find a way to seize it.\nWhen you want someone’s house,\n    you take it by fraud and violence.\nYou cheat a man of his property,\n    stealing his family’s inheritance.",
      "3": "But this is what the Lord says:\n“I will reward your evil with evil;\n    you won’t be able to pull your neck out of the noose.\nYou will no longer walk around proudly,\n    for it will be a terrible time.”",
      "4": "In that day your enemies will make fun of you\n    by singing this song of despair about you:\n    “We are finished,\n        completely ruined!\n    God has confiscated our land,\n        taking it from us.\n    He has given our fields\n        to those who betrayed us.”",
      "5": "Others will set your boundaries then,\n    and the Lord’s people will have no say\n    in how the land is divided.",
      "6": "“Don’t say such things,”\n    the people respond.\n“Don’t prophesy like that.\n    Such disasters will never come our way!”",
      "7": "Should you talk that way, O family of Israel?\n    Will the Lord’s Spirit have patience with such behavior?\nIf you would do what is right,\n    you would find my words comforting.",
      "8": "Yet to this very hour\n    my people rise against me like an enemy!\nYou steal the shirts right off the backs\n    of those who trusted you,\nmaking them as ragged as men\n    returning from battle.",
      "9": "You have evicted women from their pleasant homes\n    and forever stripped their children of all that God would give them.",
      "10": "Up! Begone!\n    This is no longer your land and home,\nfor you have filled it with sin\n    and ruined it completely.",
      "11": "Suppose a prophet full of lies would say to you,\n    “I’ll preach to you the joys of wine and alcohol!”\nThat’s just the kind of prophet you would like!",
      "12": "“Someday, O Israel, I will gather you;\n    I will gather the remnant who are left.\nI will bring you together again like sheep in a pen,\n    like a flock in its pasture.\nYes, your land will again\n    be filled with noisy crowds!",
      "13": "Your leader will break out\n    and lead you out of exile,\nout through the gates of the enemy cities,\n    back to your own land.\nYour king will lead you;\n    the Lord himself will guide you.”"

      "1": "I said, “Listen, you leaders of Israel!\n    You are supposed to know right from wrong,",
      "2": "but you are the very ones\n    who hate good and love evil.\nYou skin my people alive\n    and tear the flesh from their bones.",
      "3": "Yes, you eat my people’s flesh,\n    strip off their skin,\n    and break their bones.\nYou chop them up\n    like meat for the cooking pot.",
      "4": "Then you beg the Lord for help in times of trouble!\n    Do you really expect him to answer?\nAfter all the evil you have done,\n    he won’t even look at you!”",
      "5": "This is what the Lord says:\n    “You false prophets are leading my people astray!\nYou promise peace for those who give you food,\n    but you declare war on those who refuse to feed you.",
      "6": "Now the night will close around you,\n    cutting off all your visions.\nDarkness will cover you,\n    putting an end to your predictions.\nThe sun will set for you prophets,\n    and your day will come to an end.",
      "7": "Then you seers will be put to shame,\n    and you fortune-tellers will be disgraced.\nAnd you will cover your faces\n    because there is no answer from God.”",
      "8": "But as for me, I am filled with power—\n    with the Spirit of the Lord.\nI am filled with justice and strength\n    to boldly declare Israel’s sin and rebellion.",
      "9": "Listen to me, you leaders of Israel!\n    You hate justice and twist all that is right.",
      "10": "You are building Jerusalem\n    on a foundation of murder and corruption.",
      "11": "You rulers make decisions based on bribes;\n    you priests teach God’s laws only for a price;\nyou prophets won’t prophesy unless you are paid.\n    Yet all of you claim to depend on the Lord.\n“No harm can come to us,” you say,\n    “for the Lord is here among us.”",
      "12": "Because of you, Mount Zion will be plowed like an open field;\n    Jerusalem will be reduced to ruins!\nA thicket will grow on the heights\n    where the Temple now stands."

      "1": "In the last days, the mountain of the Lord’s house\n    will be the highest of all—\n    the most important place on earth.\nIt will be raised above the other hills,\n    and people from all over the world will stream there to worship.",
      "2": "People from many nations will come and say,\n“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,\n    to the house of Jacob’s God.\nThere he will teach us his ways,\n    and we will walk in his paths.”\nFor the Lord’s teaching will go out from Zion;\n    his word will go out from Jerusalem.",
      "3": "The Lord will mediate between peoples\n    and will settle disputes between strong nations far away.\nThey will hammer their swords into plowshares\n    and their spears into pruning hooks.\nNation will no longer fight against nation,\n    nor train for war anymore.",
      "4": "Everyone will live in peace and prosperity,\n    enjoying their own grapevines and fig trees,\n    for there will be nothing to fear.\nThe Lord of Heaven’s Armies\n    has made this promise!",
      "5": "Though the nations around us follow their idols,\n    we will follow the Lord our God forever and ever.",
      "6": "“In that coming day,” says the Lord,\n“I will gather together those who are lame,\n    those who have been exiles,\n    and those whom I have filled with grief.",
      "7": "Those who are weak will survive as a remnant;\n    those who were exiles will become a strong nation.\nThen I, the Lord, will rule from Jerusalem\n    as their king forever.”",

      "9": "But why are you now screaming in terror?\n    Have you no king to lead you?\nHave your wise people all died?\n    Pain has gripped you like a woman in childbirth.",
      "10": "Writhe and groan like a woman in labor,\n    you people of Jerusalem,\nfor now you must leave this city\n    to live in the open country.\nYou will soon be sent in exile\n    to distant Babylon.\nBut the Lord will rescue you there;\n    he will redeem you from the grip of your enemies.",
      "11": "Now many nations have gathered against you.\n    “Let her be desecrated,” they say.\n    “Let us see the destruction of Jerusalem.”",
      "12": "But they do not know the Lord’s thoughts\n    or understand his plan.\nThese nations don’t know\n    that he is gathering them together\nto be beaten and trampled\n    like sheaves of grain on a threshing floor.",
      "13": "“Rise up and crush the nations, O Jerusalem!”\n    says the Lord.\n“For I will give you iron horns and bronze hooves,\n    so you can trample many nations to pieces.\nYou will present their stolen riches to the Lord,\n    their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.”"
