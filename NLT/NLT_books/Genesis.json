      "17": "except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat its fruit, you are sure to die.”",
      "18": "Then the Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him.”",
      "19": "So the Lord God formed from the ground all the wild animals and all the birds of the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and the man chose a name for each one.",
      "20": "He gave names to all the livestock, all the birds of the sky, and all the wild animals. But still there was no helper just right for him.",

      "8": "If she is unwilling to come back with you, then you are free from this oath of mine. But under no circumstances are you to take my son there.”",
      "9": "So the servant took an oath by putting his hand under the thigh of his master, Abraham. He swore to follow Abraham’s instructions.",

      "11": "He made the camels kneel beside a well just outside the town. It was evening, and the women were coming out to draw water.",
      "12": "“O Lord, God of my master, Abraham,” he prayed. “Please give me success today, and show unfailing love to my master, Abraham.",
      "13": "See, I am standing here beside this spring, and the young women of the town are coming out to draw water.",
      "14": "This is my request. I will ask one of them, ‘Please give me a drink from your jug.’ If she says, ‘Yes, have a drink, and I will water your camels, too!’—let her be the one you have selected as Isaac’s wife. This is how I will know that you have shown unfailing love to my master.”",
      "15": "Before he had finished praying, he saw a young woman named Rebekah coming out with her water jug on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, who was the son of Abraham’s brother Nahor and his wife, Milcah.",
      "16": "Rebekah was very beautiful and old enough to be married, but she was still a virgin. She went down to the spring, filled her jug, and came up again.",
      "17": "Running over to her, the servant said, “Please give me a little drink of water from your jug.”",
      "18": "“Yes, my lord,” she answered, “have a drink.” And she quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and gave him a drink.",
      "19": "When she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels, too, until they have had enough to drink.”",
      "20": "So she quickly emptied her jug into the watering trough and ran back to the well to draw water for all his camels.",
      "21": "The servant watched her in silence, wondering whether or not the Lord had given him success in his mission.",
      "22": "Then at last, when the camels had finished drinking, he took out a gold ring for her nose and two large gold bracelets for her wrists.",
      "23": "“Whose daughter are you?” he asked. “And please tell me, would your father have any room to put us up for the night?”",
      "24": "“I am the daughter of Bethuel,” she replied. “My grandparents are Nahor and Milcah.",
      "25": "Yes, we have plenty of straw and feed for the camels, and we have room for guests.”",
      "26": "The man bowed low and worshiped the Lord.",
      "27": "“Praise the Lord, the God of my master, Abraham,” he said. “The Lord has shown unfailing love and faithfulness to my master, for he has led me straight to my master’s relatives.”",
      "28": "The young woman ran home to tell her family everything that had happened.",
      "29": "Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, who ran out to meet the man at the spring.",
      "30": "He had seen the nose-ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man had said. So he rushed out to the spring, where the man was still standing beside his camels.",
      "31": "Laban said to him, “Come and stay with us, you who are blessed by the Lord! Why are you standing here outside the town when I have a room all ready for you and a place prepared for the camels?”",
      "32": "So the man went home with Laban, and Laban unloaded the camels, gave him straw for their bedding, fed them, and provided water for the man and the camel drivers to wash their feet.",
      "33": "Then food was served. But Abraham’s servant said, “I don’t want to eat until I have told you why I have come.”\n“All right,” Laban said, “tell us.”",
      "34": "“I am Abraham’s servant,” he explained.",
      "35": "“And the Lord has greatly blessed my master; he has become a wealthy man. The Lord has given him flocks of sheep and goats, herds of cattle, a fortune in silver and gold, and many male and female servants and camels and donkeys.",
      "36": "“When Sarah, my master’s wife, was very old, she gave birth to my master’s son, and my master has given him everything he owns.",
      "37": "And my master made me take an oath. He said, ‘Do not allow my son to marry one of these local Canaanite women.",
      "38": "Go instead to my father’s house, to my relatives, and find a wife there for my son.’",
      "39": "“But I said to my master, ‘What if I can’t find a young woman who is willing to go back with me?’",
      "40": "He responded, ‘The Lord, in whose presence I have lived, will send his angel with you and will make your mission successful. Yes, you must find a wife for my son from among my relatives, from my father’s family.",
      "41": "Then you will have fulfilled your obligation. But if you go to my relatives and they refuse to let her go with you, you will be free from my oath.’",
      "42": "“So today when I came to the spring, I prayed this prayer: ‘O Lord, God of my master, Abraham, please give me success on this mission.",
      "43": "See, I am standing here beside this spring. This is my request. When a young woman comes to draw water, I will say to her, “Please give me a little drink of water from your jug.”",
      "44": "If she says, “Yes, have a drink, and I will draw water for your camels, too,” let her be the one you have selected to be the wife of my master’s son.’",
      "45": "“Before I had finished praying in my heart, I saw Rebekah coming out with her water jug on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’",
      "46": "She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and said, ‘Yes, have a drink, and I will water your camels, too!’ So I drank, and then she watered the camels.",
      "47": "“Then I asked, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘I am the daughter of Bethuel, and my grandparents are Nahor and Milcah.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.",
      "48": "“Then I bowed low and worshiped the Lord. I praised the Lord, the God of my master, Abraham, because he had led me straight to my master’s niece to be his son’s wife.",
      "49": "So tell me—will you or won’t you show unfailing love and faithfulness to my master? Please tell me yes or no, and then I’ll know what to do next.”",
      "50": "Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “The Lord has obviously brought you here, so there is nothing we can say.",
      "51": "Here is Rebekah; take her and go. Yes, let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the Lord has directed.”",
      "52": "When Abraham’s servant heard their answer, he bowed down to the ground and worshiped the Lord.",
      "53": "Then he brought out silver and gold jewelry and clothing and presented them to Rebekah. He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother.",
      "54": "Then they ate their meal, and the servant and the men with him stayed there overnight.\nBut early the next morning, Abraham’s servant said, “Send me back to my master.”",
      "55": "“But we want Rebekah to stay with us at least ten days,” her brother and mother said. “Then she can go.”",
      "56": "But he said, “Don’t delay me. The Lord has made my mission successful; now send me back so I can return to my master.”",
      "57": "“Well,” they said, “we’ll call Rebekah and ask her what she thinks.”",
      "58": "So they called Rebekah. “Are you willing to go with this man?” they asked her.\nAnd she replied, “Yes, I will go.”",
      "59": "So they said good-bye to Rebekah and sent her away with Abraham’s servant and his men. The woman who had been Rebekah’s childhood nurse went along with her.",
      "60": "They gave her this blessing as she parted: \n“Our sister, may you become\n    the mother of many millions!\nMay your descendants be strong\n    and conquer the cities of their enemies.”",
      "61": "Then Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and followed the man. So Abraham’s servant took Rebekah and went on his way.",
      "62": "Meanwhile, Isaac, whose home was in the Negev, had returned from Beer-lahai-roi.",
      "63": "One evening as he was walking and meditating in the fields, he looked up and saw the camels coming.",
      "64": "When Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac, she quickly dismounted from her camel.",
      "65": "“Who is that man walking through the fields to meet us?” she asked the servant.\nAnd he replied, “It is my master.” So Rebekah covered her face with her veil.",
      "66": "Then the servant told Isaac everything he had done.",
      "67": "And Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah’s tent, and she became his wife. He loved her deeply, and she was a special comfort to him after the death of his mother."

      "13": "At the top of the stairway stood the Lord, and he said, “I am the Lord, the God of your grandfather Abraham, and the God of your father, Isaac. The ground you are lying on belongs to you. I am giving it to you and your descendants.",
      "14": "Your descendants will be as numerous as the dust of the earth! They will spread out in all directions—to the west and the east, to the north and the south. And all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your descendants.",
      "15": "What’s more, I am with you, and I will protect you wherever you go. One day I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have finished giving you everything I have promised you.”",
      "16": "Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I wasn’t even aware of it!”",
      "17": "But he was also afraid and said, “What an awesome place this is! It is none other than the house of God, the very gateway to heaven!”",
      "18": "The next morning Jacob got up very early. He took the stone he had rested his head against, and he set it upright as a memorial pillar. Then he poured olive oil over it.",
      "19": "He named that place Bethel (which means “house of God”), although it was previously called Luz.",
      "20": "Then Jacob made this vow: “If God will indeed be with me and protect me on this journey, and if he will provide me with food and clothing,",
      "21": "and if I return safely to my father’s home, then the Lord will certainly be my God.",
      "22": "And this memorial pillar I have set up will become a place for worshiping God, and I will present to God a tenth of everything he gives me.”"

      "1": "Then Jacob hurried on, finally arriving in the land of the east.",
      "2": "He saw a well in the distance. Three flocks of sheep and goats lay in an open field beside it, waiting to be watered. But a heavy stone covered the mouth of the well.",
      "3": "It was the custom there to wait for all the flocks to arrive before removing the stone and watering the animals. Afterward the stone would be placed back over the mouth of the well.",
      "4": "Jacob went over to the shepherds and asked, “Where are you from, my friends?”\n“We are from Haran,” they answered.",
      "5": "“Do you know a man there named Laban, the grandson of Nahor?” he asked.\n“Yes, we do,” they replied.",
      "6": "“Is he doing well?” Jacob asked.\n“Yes, he’s well,” they answered. “Look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the flock now.”",
      "7": "Jacob said, “Look, it’s still broad daylight—too early to round up the animals. Why don’t you water the sheep and goats so they can get back out to pasture?”",
      "8": "“We can’t water the animals until all the flocks have arrived,” they replied. “Then the shepherds move the stone from the mouth of the well, and we water all the sheep and goats.”",
      "9": "Jacob was still talking with them when Rachel arrived with her father’s flock, for she was a shepherd.",
      "10": "And because Rachel was his cousin—the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother—and because the sheep and goats belonged to his uncle Laban, Jacob went over to the well and moved the stone from its mouth and watered his uncle’s flock.",
      "11": "Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and he wept aloud.",
      "12": "He explained to Rachel that he was her cousin on her father’s side—the son of her aunt Rebekah. So Rachel quickly ran and told her father, Laban.",
      "13": "As soon as Laban heard that his nephew Jacob had arrived, he ran out to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him home. When Jacob had told him his story,",
      "14": "Laban exclaimed, “You really are my own flesh and blood!”\nAfter Jacob had stayed with Laban for about a month,",
      "15": "Laban said to him, “You shouldn’t work for me without pay just because we are relatives. Tell me how much your wages should be.”",
      "16": "Now Laban had two daughters. The older daughter was named Leah, and the younger one was Rachel.",
      "17": "There was no sparkle in Leah’s eyes, but Rachel had a beautiful figure and a lovely face.",
      "18": "Since Jacob was in love with Rachel, he told her father, “I’ll work for you for seven years if you’ll give me Rachel, your younger daughter, as my wife.”",
      "19": "“Agreed!” Laban replied. “I’d rather give her to you than to anyone else. Stay and work with me.”",
      "20": "So Jacob worked seven years to pay for Rachel. But his love for her was so strong that it seemed to him but a few days.",
      "21": "Finally, the time came for him to marry her. “I have fulfilled my agreement,” Jacob said to Laban. “Now give me my wife so I can sleep with her.”",
      "22": "So Laban invited everyone in the neighborhood and prepared a wedding feast.",
      "23": "But that night, when it was dark, Laban took Leah to Jacob, and he slept with her.",
      "24": "(Laban had given Leah a servant, Zilpah, to be her maid.)",
      "25": "But when Jacob woke up in the morning—it was Leah! “What have you done to me?” Jacob raged at Laban. “I worked seven years for Rachel! Why have you tricked me?”",
      "26": "“It’s not our custom here to marry off a younger daughter ahead of the firstborn,” Laban replied.",
      "27": "“But wait until the bridal week is over; then we’ll give you Rachel, too—provided you promise to work another seven years for me.”",
      "28": "So Jacob agreed to work seven more years. A week after Jacob had married Leah, Laban gave him Rachel, too.",
      "29": "(Laban gave Rachel a servant, Bilhah, to be her maid.)",
      "30": "So Jacob slept with Rachel, too, and he loved her much more than Leah. He then stayed and worked for Laban the additional seven years.",
      "31": "When the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, he enabled her to have children, but Rachel could not conceive.",
      "32": "So Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “The Lord has noticed my misery, and now my husband will love me.”",
      "33": "She soon became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She named him Simeon, for she said, “The Lord heard that I was unloved and has given me another son.”",
      "34": "Then she became pregnant a third time and gave birth to another son. He was named Levi, for she said, “Surely this time my husband will feel affection for me, since I have given him three sons!”",

      "3": "Then Rachel told him, “Take my maid, Bilhah, and sleep with her. She will bear children for me, and through her I can have a family, too.”",
      "4": "So Rachel gave her servant, Bilhah, to Jacob as a wife, and he slept with her.",

      "9": "Meanwhile, Leah realized that she wasn’t getting pregnant anymore, so she took her servant, Zilpah, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.",
      "10": "Soon Zilpah presented him with a son.",

      "15": "But Leah angrily replied, “Wasn’t it enough that you stole my husband? Now will you steal my son’s mandrakes, too?”\nRachel answered, “I will let Jacob sleep with you tonight if you give me some of the mandrakes.”",
      "16": "So that evening, as Jacob was coming home from the fields, Leah went out to meet him. “You must come and sleep with me tonight!” she said. “I have paid for you with some mandrakes that my son found.” So that night he slept with Leah.",

      "27": "“Please listen to me,” Laban replied. “I have become wealthy, for the Lord has blessed me because of you.",
      "28": "Tell me how much I owe you. Whatever it is, I’ll pay it.”",

      "31": "“What wages do you want?” Laban asked again.\nJacob replied, “Don’t give me anything. Just do this one thing, and I’ll continue to tend and watch over your flocks.",
      "32": "Let me inspect your flocks today and remove all the sheep and goats that are speckled or spotted, along with all the black sheep. Give these to me as my wages.",
      "33": "In the future, when you check on the animals you have given me as my wages, you’ll see that I have been honest. If you find in my flock any goats without speckles or spots, or any sheep that are not black, you will know that I have stolen them from you.”",
      "34": "“All right,” Laban replied. “It will be as you say.”",
      "35": "But that very day Laban went out and removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted or had white patches, and all the black sheep. He placed them in the care of his own sons,",
      "36": "who took them a three-days’ journey from where Jacob was. Meanwhile, Jacob stayed and cared for the rest of Laban’s flock.",
      "37": "Then Jacob took some fresh branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled off strips of bark, making white streaks on them.",
      "38": "Then he placed these peeled branches in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, for that was where they mated.",
      "39": "And when they mated in front of the white-streaked branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.",
      "40": "Jacob separated those lambs from Laban’s flock. And at mating time he turned the flock to face Laban’s animals that were streaked or black. This is how he built his own flock instead of increasing Laban’s.",
      "41": "Whenever the stronger females were ready to mate, Jacob would place the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of them. Then they would mate in front of the branches.",
      "42": "But he didn’t do this with the weaker ones, so the weaker lambs belonged to Laban, and the stronger ones were Jacob’s.",

      "3": "Then the Lord said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your father and grandfather and to your relatives there, and I will be with you.”",
      "4": "So Jacob called Rachel and Leah out to the field where he was watching his flock.",
      "5": "He said to them, “I have noticed that your father’s attitude toward me has changed. But the God of my father has been with me.",
      "6": "You know how hard I have worked for your father,",
      "7": "but he has cheated me, changing my wages ten times. But God has not allowed him to do me any harm.",
      "8": "For if he said, ‘The speckled animals will be your wages,’ the whole flock began to produce speckled young. And when he changed his mind and said, ‘The striped animals will be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced striped young.",
      "9": "In this way, God has taken your father’s animals and given them to me.",
      "10": "“One time during the mating season, I had a dream and saw that the male goats mating with the females were streaked, speckled, and spotted.",
      "11": "Then in my dream, the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ And I replied, ‘Yes, here I am.’",
      "12": "“The angel said, ‘Look up, and you will see that only the streaked, speckled, and spotted males are mating with the females of your flock. For I have seen how Laban has treated you.",

      "14": "Rachel and Leah responded, “That’s fine with us! We won’t inherit any of our father’s wealth anyway.",
      "15": "He has reduced our rights to those of foreign women. And after he sold us, he wasted the money you paid him for us.",
      "16": "All the wealth God has given you from our father legally belongs to us and our children. So go ahead and do whatever God has told you.”",
      "17": "So Jacob put his wives and children on camels,",

      "19": "At the time they left, Laban was some distance away, shearing his sheep. Rachel stole her father’s household idols and took them with her.",
      "20": "Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, for they set out secretly and never told Laban they were leaving.",
      "21": "So Jacob took all his possessions with him and crossed the Euphrates River, heading for the hill country of Gilead.",
      "22": "Three days later, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.",
      "23": "So he gathered a group of his relatives and set out in hot pursuit. He caught up with Jacob seven days later in the hill country of Gilead.",

      "26": "“What do you mean by deceiving me like this?” Laban demanded. “How dare you drag my daughters away like prisoners of war?",
      "27": "Why did you slip away secretly? Why did you deceive me? And why didn’t you say you wanted to leave? I would have given you a farewell feast, with singing and music, accompanied by tambourines and harps.",
      "28": "Why didn’t you let me kiss my daughters and grandchildren and tell them good-bye? You have acted very foolishly!",
      "29": "I could destroy you, but the God of your father appeared to me last night and warned me, ‘Leave Jacob alone!’",
      "30": "I can understand your feeling that you must go, and your intense longing for your father’s home. But why have you stolen my gods?”",
      "31": "“I rushed away because I was afraid,” Jacob answered. “I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.",
      "32": "But as for your gods, see if you can find them, and let the person who has taken them die! And if you find anything else that belongs to you, identify it before all these relatives of ours, and I will give it back!” But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the household idols.",
      "33": "Laban went first into Jacob’s tent to search there, then into Leah’s, and then the tents of the two servant wives—but he found nothing. Finally, he went into Rachel’s tent.",
      "34": "But Rachel had taken the household idols and hidden them in her camel saddle, and now she was sitting on them. When Laban had thoroughly searched her tent without finding them,",
      "35": "she said to her father, “Please, sir, forgive me if I don’t get up for you. I’m having my monthly period.” So Laban continued his search, but he could not find the household idols.",
      "36": "Then Jacob became very angry, and he challenged Laban. “What’s my crime?” he demanded. “What have I done wrong to make you chase after me as though I were a criminal?",
      "37": "You have rummaged through everything I own. Now show me what you found that belongs to you! Set it out here in front of us, before our relatives, for all to see. Let them judge between us!",
      "38": "“For twenty years I have been with you, caring for your flocks. In all that time your sheep and goats never miscarried. In all those years I never used a single ram of yours for food.",
      "39": "If any were attacked and killed by wild animals, I never showed you the carcass and asked you to reduce the count of your flock. No, I took the loss myself! You made me pay for every stolen animal, whether it was taken in broad daylight or in the dark of night.",
      "40": "“I worked for you through the scorching heat of the day and through cold and sleepless nights.",
      "41": "Yes, for twenty years I slaved in your house! I worked for fourteen years earning your two daughters, and then six more years for your flock. And you changed my wages ten times!",
      "42": "In fact, if the God of my father had not been on my side—the God of Abraham and the fearsome God of Isaac—you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen your abuse and my hard work. That is why he appeared to you last night and rebuked you!”",
      "43": "Then Laban replied to Jacob, “These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks—in fact, everything you see is mine. But what can I do now about my daughters and their children?",
      "44": "So come, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and it will be a witness to our commitment.”",
      "45": "So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument.",

      "47": "To commemorate the event, Laban called the place Jegar-sahadutha (which means “witness pile” in Aramaic), and Jacob called it Galeed (which means “witness pile” in Hebrew).",
      "48": "Then Laban declared, “This pile of stones will stand as a witness to remind us of the covenant we have made today.” This explains why it was called Galeed—“Witness Pile.”",
      "49": "But it was also called Mizpah (which means “watchtower”), for Laban said, “May the Lord keep watch between us to make sure that we keep this covenant when we are out of each other’s sight.",
      "50": "If you mistreat my daughters or if you marry other wives, God will see it even if no one else does. He is a witness to this covenant between us.",
      "51": "“See this pile of stones,” Laban continued, “and see this monument I have set between us.",
      "52": "They stand between us as witnesses of our vows. I will never pass this pile of stones to harm you, and you must never pass these stones or this monument to harm me.",
      "53": "I call on the God of our ancestors—the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of my grandfather Nahor—to serve as a judge between us.”\nSo Jacob took an oath before the fearsome God of his father, Isaac, to respect the boundary line.",
      "54": "Then Jacob offered a sacrifice to God there on the mountain and invited everyone to a covenant feast. After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain.",

      "18": "You must reply, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob, but they are a gift for his master Esau. Look, he is coming right behind us.’”",

      "3": "So Joseph’s ten older brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain.",
      "4": "But Jacob wouldn’t let Joseph’s younger brother, Benjamin, go with them, for fear some harm might come to him.",
      "5": "So Jacob’s sons arrived in Egypt along with others to buy food, for the famine was in Canaan as well.",
      "6": "Since Joseph was governor of all Egypt and in charge of selling grain to all the people, it was to him that his brothers came. When they arrived, they bowed before him with their faces to the ground.",

      "13": "“Sir,” they said, “there are actually twelve of us. We, your servants, are all brothers, sons of a man living in the land of Canaan. Our youngest brother is back there with our father right now, and one of our brothers is no longer with us.”",
      "14": "But Joseph insisted, “As I said, you are spies!",
      "15": "This is how I will test your story. I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you will never leave Egypt unless your youngest brother comes here!",
      "16": "One of you must go and get your brother. I’ll keep the rest of you here in prison. Then we’ll find out whether or not your story is true. By the life of Pharaoh, if it turns out that you don’t have a younger brother, then I’ll know you are spies.”",

      "28": "“Look!” he exclaimed to his brothers. “My money has been returned; it’s here in my sack!” Then their hearts sank. Trembling, they said to each other, “What has God done to us?”",
