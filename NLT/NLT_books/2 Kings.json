      "1": "After King Ahab’s death, the land of Moab rebelled against Israel.",
      "2": "One day Israel’s new king, Ahaziah, fell through the latticework of an upper room at his palace in Samaria and was seriously injured. So he sent messengers to the temple of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, to ask whether he would recover.",
      "3": "But the angel of the Lord told Elijah, who was from Tishbe, “Go and confront the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is there no God in Israel? Why are you going to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, to ask whether the king will recover?",
      "4": "Now, therefore, this is what the Lord says: You will never leave the bed you are lying on; you will surely die.’” So Elijah went to deliver the message.",
      "5": "When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have you returned so soon?”",
      "6": "They replied, “A man came up to us and told us to go back to the king and give him this message. ‘This is what the Lord says: Is there no God in Israel? Why are you sending men to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, to ask whether you will recover? Therefore, because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on; you will surely die.’”",
      "7": "“What sort of man was he?” the king demanded. “What did he look like?”",
      "8": "They replied, “He was a hairy man, and he wore a leather belt around his waist.”\n“Elijah from Tishbe!” the king exclaimed.",
      "9": "Then he sent an army captain with fifty soldiers to arrest him. They found him sitting on top of a hill. The captain said to him, “Man of God, the king has commanded you to come down with us.”",
      "10": "But Elijah replied to the captain, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your fifty men!” Then fire fell from heaven and killed them all.",
      "11": "So the king sent another captain with fifty men. The captain said to him, “Man of God, the king demands that you come down at once.”",
      "12": "Elijah replied, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your fifty men!” And again the fire of God fell from heaven and killed them all.",
      "13": "Once more the king sent a third captain with fifty men. But this time the captain went up the hill and fell to his knees before Elijah. He pleaded with him, “O man of God, please spare my life and the lives of these, your fifty servants.",
      "14": "See how the fire from heaven came down and destroyed the first two groups. But now please spare my life!”",
      "15": "Then the angel of the Lord said to Elijah, “Go down with him, and don’t be afraid of him.” So Elijah got up and went with him to the king.",
      "16": "And Elijah said to the king, “This is what the Lord says: Why did you send messengers to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, to ask whether you will recover? Is there no God in Israel to answer your question? Therefore, because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on; you will surely die.”",
      "17": "So Ahaziah died, just as the Lord had promised through Elijah. Since Ahaziah did not have a son to succeed him, his brother Joram became the next king. This took place in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.",
      "18": "The rest of the events in Ahaziah’s reign and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel."

    "2": {
      "1": "When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were traveling from Gilgal.",
      "2": "And Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, for the Lord has told me to go to Bethel.”\nBut Elisha replied, “As surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live, I will never leave you!” So they went down together to Bethel.",
      "3": "The group of prophets from Bethel came to Elisha and asked him, “Did you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today?”\n“Of course I know,” Elisha answered. “But be quiet about it.”",
      "4": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, for the Lord has told me to go to Jericho.”\nBut Elisha replied again, “As surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live, I will never leave you.” So they went on together to Jericho.",
      "5": "Then the group of prophets from Jericho came to Elisha and asked him, “Did you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today?”\n“Of course I know,” Elisha answered. “But be quiet about it.”",
      "6": "Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, for the Lord has told me to go to the Jordan River.”\nBut again Elisha replied, “As surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live, I will never leave you.” So they went on together.",
      "7": "Fifty men from the group of prophets also went and watched from a distance as Elijah and Elisha stopped beside the Jordan River.",
      "8": "Then Elijah folded his cloak together and struck the water with it. The river divided, and the two of them went across on dry ground!",
      "9": "When they came to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I can do for you before I am taken away.”\nAnd Elisha replied, “Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit and become your successor.”",
      "10": "“You have asked a difficult thing,” Elijah replied. “If you see me when I am taken from you, then you will get your request. But if not, then you won’t.”",
      "11": "As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire appeared, drawn by horses of fire. It drove between the two men, separating them, and Elijah was carried by a whirlwind into heaven.",
      "12": "Elisha saw it and cried out, “My father! My father! I see the chariots and charioteers of Israel!” And as they disappeared from sight, Elisha tore his clothes in distress.",
      "13": "Elisha picked up Elijah’s cloak, which had fallen when he was taken up. Then Elisha returned to the bank of the Jordan River.",
      "14": "He struck the water with Elijah’s cloak and cried out, “Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?” Then the river divided, and Elisha went across.",
      "15": "When the group of prophets from Jericho saw from a distance what happened, they exclaimed, “Elijah’s spirit rests upon Elisha!” And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.",
      "16": "“Sir,” they said, “just say the word and fifty of our strongest men will search the wilderness for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has left him on some mountain or in some valley.”\n“No,” Elisha said, “don’t send them.”",
      "17": "But they kept urging him until they shamed him into agreeing, and he finally said, “All right, send them.” So fifty men searched for three days but did not find Elijah.",
      "18": "Elisha was still at Jericho when they returned. “Didn’t I tell you not to go?” he asked.",
      "19": "One day the leaders of the town of Jericho visited Elisha. “We have a problem, my lord,” they told him. “This town is located in pleasant surroundings, as you can see. But the water is bad, and the land is unproductive.”",
      "20": "Elisha said, “Bring me a new bowl with salt in it.” So they brought it to him.",
      "21": "Then he went out to the spring that supplied the town with water and threw the salt into it. And he said, “This is what the Lord says: I have purified this water. It will no longer cause death or infertility.”",
      "22": "And the water has remained pure ever since, just as Elisha said.",
      "23": "Elisha left Jericho and went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, a group of boys from the town began mocking and making fun of him. “Go away, baldy!” they chanted. “Go away, baldy!”",
      "24": "Elisha turned around and looked at them, and he cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of them.",
      "25": "From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel and finally returned to Samaria."

      "1": "Ahab’s son Joram began to rule over Israel in the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat’s reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria twelve years.",
      "2": "He did what was evil in the Lord’s sight, but not to the same extent as his father and mother. He at least tore down the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had set up.",
      "3": "Nevertheless, he continued in the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had committed and led the people of Israel to commit.",
      "4": "King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder. He used to pay the king of Israel an annual tribute of 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams.",
      "5": "But after Ahab’s death, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.",
      "6": "So King Joram promptly mustered the army of Israel and marched from Samaria.",
      "7": "On the way, he sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you join me in battle against him?”\nAnd Jehoshaphat replied, “Why, of course! You and I are as one. My troops are your troops, and my horses are your horses.”",
      "8": "Then Jehoshaphat asked, “What route will we take?”\n“We will attack from the wilderness of Edom,” Joram replied.",
      "9": "The king of Edom and his troops joined them, and all three armies traveled along a roundabout route through the wilderness for seven days. But there was no water for the men or their animals.",
      "10": "“What should we do?” the king of Israel cried out. “The Lord has brought the three of us here to let the king of Moab defeat us.”",
      "11": "But King Jehoshaphat of Judah asked, “Is there no prophet of the Lord with us? If there is, we can ask the Lord what to do through him.”\nOne of King Joram’s officers replied, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to be Elijah’s personal assistant.”",
      "12": "Jehoshaphat said, “Yes, the Lord speaks through him.” So the king of Israel, King Jehoshaphat of Judah, and the king of Edom went to consult with Elisha.",
      "13": "“Why are you coming to me?” Elisha asked the king of Israel. “Go to the pagan prophets of your father and mother!”\nBut King Joram of Israel said, “No! For it was the Lord who called us three kings here—only to be defeated by the king of Moab!”",
      "14": "Elisha replied, “As surely as the Lord Almighty lives, whom I serve, I wouldn’t even bother with you except for my respect for King Jehoshaphat of Judah.",
      "15": "Now bring me someone who can play the harp.”\nWhile the harp was being played, the power of the Lord came upon Elisha,",
      "16": "and he said, “This is what the Lord says: This dry valley will be filled with pools of water!",
      "17": "You will see neither wind nor rain, says the Lord, but this valley will be filled with water. You will have plenty for yourselves and your cattle and other animals.",
      "18": "But this is only a simple thing for the Lord, for he will make you victorious over the army of Moab!",
      "19": "You will conquer the best of their towns, even the fortified ones. You will cut down all their good trees, stop up all their springs, and ruin all their good land with stones.”",
      "20": "The next day at about the time when the morning sacrifice was offered, water suddenly appeared! It was flowing from the direction of Edom, and soon there was water everywhere.",
      "21": "Meanwhile, when the people of Moab heard about the three armies marching against them, they mobilized every man who was old enough to strap on a sword, and they stationed themselves along their border.",
      "22": "But when they got up the next morning, the sun was shining across the water, making it appear red to the Moabites—like blood.",
      "23": "“It’s blood!” the Moabites exclaimed. “The three armies must have attacked and killed each other! Let’s go, men of Moab, and collect the plunder!”",
      "24": "But when the Moabites arrived at the Israelite camp, the army of Israel rushed out and attacked them until they turned and ran. The army of Israel chased them into the land of Moab, destroying everything as they went.",
      "25": "They destroyed the towns, covered their good land with stones, stopped up all the springs, and cut down all the good trees. Finally, only Kir-hareseth and its stone walls were left, but men with slings surrounded and attacked it.",
      "26": "When the king of Moab saw that he was losing the battle, he led 700 of his swordsmen in a desperate attempt to break through the enemy lines near the king of Edom, but they failed.",
      "27": "Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would have been the next king, and sacrificed him as a burnt offering on the wall. So there was great anger against Israel, and the Israelites withdrew and returned to their own land."

    "4": {
      "1": "One day the widow of a member of the group of prophets came to Elisha and cried out, “My husband who served you is dead, and you know how he feared the Lord. But now a creditor has come, threatening to take my two sons as slaves.”",
      "2": "“What can I do to help you?” Elisha asked. “Tell me, what do you have in the house?”\n“Nothing at all, except a flask of olive oil,” she replied.",
      "3": "And Elisha said, “Borrow as many empty jars as you can from your friends and neighbors.",
      "4": "Then go into your house with your sons and shut the door behind you. Pour olive oil from your flask into the jars, setting each one aside when it is filled.”",
      "5": "So she did as she was told. Her sons kept bringing jars to her, and she filled one after another.",
      "6": "Soon every container was full to the brim!\n“Bring me another jar,” she said to one of her sons.\n“There aren’t any more!” he told her. And then the olive oil stopped flowing.",
      "7": "When she told the man of God what had happened, he said to her, “Now sell the olive oil and pay your debts, and you and your sons can live on what is left over.”",
      "8": "One day Elisha went to the town of Shunem. A wealthy woman lived there, and she urged him to come to her home for a meal. After that, whenever he passed that way, he would stop there for something to eat.",
      "9": "She said to her husband, “I am sure this man who stops in from time to time is a holy man of God.",
      "10": "Let’s build a small room for him on the roof and furnish it with a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp. Then he will have a place to stay whenever he comes by.”",
      "11": "One day Elisha returned to Shunem, and he went up to this upper room to rest.",
      "12": "He said to his servant Gehazi, “Tell the woman from Shunem I want to speak to her.” When she appeared,",
      "13": "Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tell her, ‘We appreciate the kind concern you have shown us. What can we do for you? Can we put in a good word for you to the king or to the commander of the army?’”\n“No,” she replied, “my family takes good care of me.”",
      "14": "Later Elisha asked Gehazi, “What can we do for her?”\nGehazi replied, “She doesn’t have a son, and her husband is an old man.”",
      "15": "“Call her back again,” Elisha told him. When the woman returned, Elisha said to her as she stood in the doorway,",
      "16": "“Next year at this time you will be holding a son in your arms!”\n“No, my lord!” she cried. “O man of God, don’t deceive me and get my hopes up like that.”",
      "17": "But sure enough, the woman soon became pregnant. And at that time the following year she had a son, just as Elisha had said.",
      "18": "One day when her child was older, he went out to help his father, who was working with the harvesters.",
      "19": "Suddenly he cried out, “My head hurts! My head hurts!”\nHis father said to one of the servants, “Carry him home to his mother.”",
      "20": "So the servant took him home, and his mother held him on her lap. But around noontime he died.",
      "21": "She carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and left him there.",
      "22": "She sent a message to her husband: “Send one of the servants and a donkey so that I can hurry to the man of God and come right back.”",
      "23": "“Why go today?” he asked. “It is neither a new moon festival nor a Sabbath.”\nBut she said, “It will be all right.”",
      "24": "So she saddled the donkey and said to the servant, “Hurry! Don’t slow down unless I tell you to.”",
      "25": "As she approached the man of God at Mount Carmel, Elisha saw her in the distance. He said to Gehazi, “Look, the woman from Shunem is coming.",
      "26": "Run out to meet her and ask her, ‘Is everything all right with you, your husband, and your child?’”\n“Yes,” the woman told Gehazi, “everything is fine.”",
      "27": "But when she came to the man of God at the mountain, she fell to the ground before him and caught hold of his feet. Gehazi began to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone. She is deeply troubled, but the Lord has not told me what it is.”",
      "28": "Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? And didn’t I say, ‘Don’t deceive me and get my hopes up’?”",
      "29": "Then Elisha said to Gehazi, “Get ready to travel; take my staff and go! Don’t talk to anyone along the way. Go quickly and lay the staff on the child’s face.”",
      "30": "But the boy’s mother said, “As surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live, I won’t go home unless you go with me.” So Elisha returned with her.",
      "31": "Gehazi hurried on ahead and laid the staff on the child’s face, but nothing happened. There was no sign of life. He returned to meet Elisha and told him, “The child is still dead.”",
      "32": "When Elisha arrived, the child was indeed dead, lying there on the prophet’s bed.",
      "33": "He went in alone and shut the door behind him and prayed to the Lord.",
      "34": "Then he lay down on the child’s body, placing his mouth on the child’s mouth, his eyes on the child’s eyes, and his hands on the child’s hands. And as he stretched out on him, the child’s body began to grow warm again!",
      "35": "Elisha got up, walked back and forth across the room once, and then stretched himself out again on the child. This time the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes!",
      "36": "Then Elisha summoned Gehazi. “Call the child’s mother!” he said. And when she came in, Elisha said, “Here, take your son!”",
      "37": "She fell at his feet and bowed before him, overwhelmed with gratitude. Then she took her son in her arms and carried him downstairs.",
      "38": "Elisha now returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. One day as the group of prophets was seated before him, he said to his servant, “Put a large pot on the fire, and make some stew for the rest of the group.”",
      "39": "One of the young men went out into the field to gather herbs and came back with a pocketful of wild gourds. He shredded them and put them into the pot without realizing they were poisonous.",
      "40": "Some of the stew was served to the men. But after they had eaten a bite or two they cried out, “Man of God, there’s poison in this stew!” So they would not eat it.",
      "41": "Elisha said, “Bring me some flour.” Then he threw it into the pot and said, “Now it’s all right; go ahead and eat.” And then it did not harm them.",
      "42": "One day a man from Baal-shalishah brought the man of God a sack of fresh grain and twenty loaves of barley bread made from the first grain of his harvest. Elisha said, “Give it to the people so they can eat.”",
      "43": "“What?” his servant exclaimed. “Feed a hundred people with only this?”\nBut Elisha repeated, “Give it to the people so they can eat, for this is what the Lord says: Everyone will eat, and there will even be some left over!”",
      "44": "And when they gave it to the people, there was plenty for all and some left over, just as the Lord had promised."

      "1": "The king of Aram had great admiration for Naaman, the commander of his army, because through him the Lord had given Aram great victories. But though Naaman was a mighty warrior, he suffered from leprosy.",
      "2": "At this time Aramean raiders had invaded the land of Israel, and among their captives was a young girl who had been given to Naaman’s wife as a maid.",
      "3": "One day the girl said to her mistress, “I wish my master would go to see the prophet in Samaria. He would heal him of his leprosy.”",
      "4": "So Naaman told the king what the young girl from Israel had said.",
      "5": "“Go and visit the prophet,” the king of Aram told him. “I will send a letter of introduction for you to take to the king of Israel.” So Naaman started out, carrying as gifts 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold, and ten sets of clothing.",
      "6": "The letter to the king of Israel said: “With this letter I present my servant Naaman. I want you to heal him of his leprosy.”",
      "7": "When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in dismay and said, “Am I God, that I can give life and take it away? Why is this man asking me to heal someone with leprosy? I can see that he’s just trying to pick a fight with me.”",
      "8": "But when Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes in dismay, he sent this message to him: “Why are you so upset? Send Naaman to me, and he will learn that there is a true prophet here in Israel.”",
      "9": "So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and waited at the door of Elisha’s house.",
      "10": "But Elisha sent a messenger out to him with this message: “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan River. Then your skin will be restored, and you will be healed of your leprosy.”",
      "11": "But Naaman became angry and stalked away. “I thought he would certainly come out to meet me!” he said. “I expected him to wave his hand over the leprosy and call on the name of the Lord his God and heal me!",
      "12": "Aren’t the rivers of Damascus, the Abana and the Pharpar, better than any of the rivers of Israel? Why shouldn’t I wash in them and be healed?” So Naaman turned and went away in a rage.",
      "13": "But his officers tried to reason with him and said, “Sir, if the prophet had told you to do something very difficult, wouldn’t you have done it? So you should certainly obey him when he says simply, ‘Go and wash and be cured!’”",
      "14": "So Naaman went down to the Jordan River and dipped himself seven times, as the man of God had instructed him. And his skin became as healthy as the skin of a young child, and he was healed!",
      "15": "Then Naaman and his entire party went back to find the man of God. They stood before him, and Naaman said, “Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.”",
      "16": "But Elisha replied, “As surely as the Lord lives, whom I serve, I will not accept any gifts.” And though Naaman urged him to take the gift, Elisha refused.",
      "17": "Then Naaman said, “All right, but please allow me to load two of my mules with earth from this place, and I will take it back home with me. From now on I will never again offer burnt offerings or sacrifices to any other god except the Lord.",
      "18": "However, may the Lord pardon me in this one thing: When my master the king goes into the temple of the god Rimmon to worship there and leans on my arm, may the Lord pardon me when I bow, too.”",
      "19": "“Go in peace,” Elisha said. So Naaman started home again.",
      "20": "But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said to himself, “My master should not have let this Aramean get away without accepting any of his gifts. As surely as the Lord lives, I will chase after him and get something from him.”",
      "21": "So Gehazi set off after Naaman.\nWhen Naaman saw Gehazi running after him, he climbed down from his chariot and went to meet him. “Is everything all right?” Naaman asked.",
      "22": "“Yes,” Gehazi said, “but my master has sent me to tell you that two young prophets from the hill country of Ephraim have just arrived. He would like 75 pounds of silver and two sets of clothing to give to them.”",
      "23": "“By all means, take twice as much silver,” Naaman insisted. He gave him two sets of clothing, tied up the money in two bags, and sent two of his servants to carry the gifts for Gehazi.",
      "24": "But when they arrived at the citadel, Gehazi took the gifts from the servants and sent the men back. Then he went and hid the gifts inside the house.",
      "25": "When he went in to his master, Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?”\n“I haven’t been anywhere,” he replied.",
      "26": "But Elisha asked him, “Don’t you realize that I was there in spirit when Naaman stepped down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to receive money and clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and cattle, and male and female servants?",
      "27": "Because you have done this, you and your descendants will suffer from Naaman’s leprosy forever.” When Gehazi left the room, he was covered with leprosy; his skin was white as snow."

      "1": "One day the group of prophets came to Elisha and told him, “As you can see, this place where we meet with you is too small.",
      "2": "Let’s go down to the Jordan River, where there are plenty of logs. There we can build a new place for us to meet.”\n“All right,” he told them, “go ahead.”",
      "3": "“Please come with us,” someone suggested.\n“I will,” he said.",
      "4": "So he went with them.\nWhen they arrived at the Jordan, they began cutting down trees.",
      "5": "But as one of them was cutting a tree, his ax head fell into the river. “Oh, sir!” he cried. “It was a borrowed ax!”",
      "6": "“Where did it fall?” the man of God asked. When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot. Then the ax head floated to the surface.",
      "7": "“Grab it,” Elisha said. And the man reached out and grabbed it.",
      "8": "When the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he would confer with his officers and say, “We will mobilize our forces at such and such a place.”",
      "9": "But immediately Elisha, the man of God, would warn the king of Israel, “Do not go near that place, for the Arameans are planning to mobilize their troops there.”",
      "10": "So the king of Israel would send word to the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he would be on the alert there.",
      "11": "The king of Aram became very upset over this. He called his officers together and demanded, “Which of you is the traitor? Who has been informing the king of Israel of my plans?”",
      "12": "“It’s not us, my lord the king,” one of the officers replied. “Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in the privacy of your bedroom!”",
      "13": "“Go and find out where he is,” the king commanded, “so I can send troops to seize him.”\nAnd the report came back: “Elisha is at Dothan.”",
      "14": "So one night the king of Aram sent a great army with many chariots and horses to surround the city.",
      "15": "When the servant of the man of God got up early the next morning and went outside, there were troops, horses, and chariots everywhere. “Oh, sir, what will we do now?” the young man cried to Elisha.",
      "16": "“Don’t be afraid!” Elisha told him. “For there are more on our side than on theirs!”",

      "10": "So they went back to the city and told the gatekeepers what had happened. “We went out to the Aramean camp,” they said, “and no one was there! The horses and donkeys were tethered and the tents were all in order, but there wasn’t a single person around!”",

He also defiled the pagan shrines, where they had offered sacrifices—all the way from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the shrines at the entrance to the gate of Joshua, the governor of Jerusalem. This gate was located to the left of the city gate as one enters the city.",
      "9": "The priests who had served at the pagan shrines were not allowed to serve at the Lord’s altar in Jerusalem, but they were allowed to eat unleavened bread with the other priests.",

      "11": "He removed from the entrance of the Lord’s Temple the horse statues that the former kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were near the quarters of Nathan-melech the eunuch, an officer of the court. The king also burned the chariots dedicated to the sun.",

      "16": "Then Josiah turned around and noticed several tombs in the side of the hill. He ordered that the bones be brought out, and he burned them on the altar at Bethel to desecrate it. (This happened just as the Lord had promised through the man of God when Jeroboam stood beside the altar at the festival.)\nThen Josiah turned and looked up at the tomb of the man of God who had predicted these things.",
      "17": "“What is that monument over there?” Josiah asked.\nAnd the people of the town told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted the very things that you have just done to the altar at Bethel!”",
      "18": "Josiah replied, “Leave it alone. Don’t disturb his bones.” So they did not burn his bones or those of the old prophet from Samaria.",
