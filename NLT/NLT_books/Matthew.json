      "9": "After this interview the wise men went their way. And the star they had seen in the east guided them to Bethlehem. It went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was.",
      "10": "When they saw the star, they were filled with joy!",
      "11": "They entered the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.",
      "12": "When it was time to leave, they returned to their own country by another route, for God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.",
      "13": "After the wise men were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up! Flee to Egypt with the child and his mother,” the angel said. “Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”",
      "14": "That night Joseph left for Egypt with the child and Mary, his mother,",

      "12": "He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.”",
      "13": "Then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.",
      "14": "But John tried to talk him out of it. “I am the one who needs to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why are you coming to me?”",
      "15": "But Jesus said, “It should be done, for we must carry out all that God requires.” So John agreed to baptize him.",
      "16": "After his baptism, as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him.",

      "12": "When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he left Judea and returned to Galilee.",
      "13": "He went first to Nazareth, then left there and moved to Capernaum, beside the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.",
      "14": "This fulfilled what God said through the prophet Isaiah:",
