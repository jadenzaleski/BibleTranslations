  "Judges": {
    "1": {
      "1": "After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the Lord, “Which tribe should go first to attack the Canaanites?”",
      "2": "The Lord answered, “Judah, for I have given them victory over the land.”",
      "3": "The men of Judah said to their relatives from the tribe of Simeon, “Join with us to fight against the Canaanites living in the territory allotted to us. Then we will help you conquer your territory.” So the men of Simeon went with Judah.",
      "4": "When the men of Judah attacked, the Lord gave them victory over the Canaanites and Perizzites, and they killed 10,000 enemy warriors at the town of Bezek.",
      "5": "While at Bezek they encountered King Adoni-bezek and fought against him, and the Canaanites and Perizzites were defeated.",
      "6": "Adoni-bezek escaped, but the Israelites soon captured him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.",
      "7": "Adoni-bezek said, “I once had seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off, eating scraps from under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them.” They took him to Jerusalem, and he died there.",
      "8": "The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it, killing all its people and setting the city on fire.",
      "9": "Then they went down to fight the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev, and the western foothills.",
      "10": "Judah marched against the Canaanites in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath-arba), defeating the forces of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.",
      "11": "From there they went to fight against the people living in the town of Debir (formerly called Kiriath-sepher).",
      "12": "Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the one who attacks and captures Kiriath-sepher.”",
      "13": "Othniel, the son of Caleb’s younger brother, Kenaz, was the one who conquered it, so Acsah became Othniel’s wife.",
      "14": "When Acsah married Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she got down off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What’s the matter?”",
      "15": "She said, “Let me have another gift. You have already given me land in the Negev; now please give me springs of water, too.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.",
      "16": "When the tribe of Judah left Jericho—the city of palms—the Kenites, who were descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, traveled with them into the wilderness of Judah. They settled among the people there, near the town of Arad in the Negev.",
      "17": "Then Judah joined with Simeon to fight against the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they completely destroyed the town. So the town was named Hormah.",
      "18": "In addition, Judah captured the towns of Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, along with their surrounding territories.",
      "19": "The Lord was with the people of Judah, and they took possession of the hill country. But they failed to drive out the people living in the plains, who had iron chariots.",
      "20": "The town of Hebron was given to Caleb as Moses had promised. And Caleb drove out the people living there, who were descendants of the three sons of Anak.",
      "21": "The tribe of Benjamin, however, failed to drive out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites live in Jerusalem among the people of Benjamin.",
      "22": "The descendants of Joseph attacked the town of Bethel, and the Lord was with them.",
      "23": "They sent men to scout out Bethel (formerly known as Luz).",
      "24": "They confronted a man coming out of the town and said to him, “Show us a way into the town, and we will have mercy on you.”",
      "25": "So he showed them a way in, and they killed everyone in the town except that man and his family.",
      "26": "Later the man moved to the land of the Hittites, where he built a town. He named it Luz, which is its name to this day.",
      "27": "The tribe of Manasseh failed to drive out the people living in Beth-shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and all their surrounding settlements, because the Canaanites were determined to stay in that region.",
      "28": "When the Israelites grew stronger, they forced the Canaanites to work as slaves, but they never did drive them completely out of the land.",
      "29": "The tribe of Ephraim failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, so the Canaanites continued to live there among them.",
      "30": "The tribe of Zebulun failed to drive out the residents of Kitron and Nahalol, so the Canaanites continued to live among them. But the Canaanites were forced to work as slaves for the people of Zebulun.",
      "31": "The tribe of Asher failed to drive out the residents of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob.",
      "32": "Instead, the people of Asher moved in among the Canaanites, who controlled the land, for they failed to drive them out.",
      "33": "Likewise, the tribe of Naphtali failed to drive out the residents of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath. Instead, they moved in among the Canaanites, who controlled the land. Nevertheless, the people of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were forced to work as slaves for the people of Naphtali.",
      "34": "As for the tribe of Dan, the Amorites forced them back into the hill country and would not let them come down into the plains.",
      "35": "The Amorites were determined to stay in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim, but when the descendants of Joseph became stronger, they forced the Amorites to work as slaves.",
      "36": "The boundary of the Amorites ran from Scorpion Pass to Sela and continued upward from there."

    "2": {
      "1": "The angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said to the Israelites, “I brought you out of Egypt into this land that I swore to give your ancestors, and I said I would never break my covenant with you.",
      "2": "For your part, you were not to make any covenants with the people living in this land; instead, you were to destroy their altars. But you disobeyed my command. Why did you do this?",
      "3": "So now I declare that I will no longer drive out the people living in your land. They will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a constant temptation to you.”",
      "4": "When the angel of the Lord finished speaking to all the Israelites, the people wept loudly.",
      "5": "So they called the place Bokim (which means “weeping”), and they offered sacrifices there to the Lord.",
      "6": "After Joshua sent the people away, each of the tribes left to take possession of the land allotted to them.",
      "7": "And the Israelites served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and the leaders who outlived him—those who had seen all the great things the Lord had done for Israel.",
      "8": "Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110.",
      "9": "They buried him in the land he had been allocated, at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.",
      "10": "After that generation died, another generation grew up who did not acknowledge the Lord or remember the mighty things he had done for Israel.",
      "11": "The Israelites did evil in the Lord’s sight and served the images of Baal.",
      "12": "They abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They went after other gods, worshiping the gods of the people around them. And they angered the Lord.",
      "13": "They abandoned the Lord to serve Baal and the images of Ashtoreth.",
      "14": "This made the Lord burn with anger against Israel, so he handed them over to raiders who stole their possessions. He turned them over to their enemies all around, and they were no longer able to resist them.",
      "15": "Every time Israel went out to battle, the Lord fought against them, causing them to be defeated, just as he had warned. And the people were in great distress.",
      "16": "Then the Lord raised up judges to rescue the Israelites from their attackers.",
      "17": "Yet Israel did not listen to the judges but prostituted themselves by worshiping other gods. How quickly they turned away from the path of their ancestors, who had walked in obedience to the Lord’s commands.",
      "18": "Whenever the Lord raised up a judge over Israel, he was with that judge and rescued the people from their enemies throughout the judge’s lifetime. For the Lord took pity on his people, who were burdened by oppression and suffering.",
      "19": "But when the judge died, the people returned to their corrupt ways, behaving worse than those who had lived before them. They went after other gods, serving and worshiping them. And they refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.",
      "20": "So the Lord burned with anger against Israel. He said, “Because these people have violated my covenant, which I made with their ancestors, and have ignored my commands,",
      "21": "I will no longer drive out the nations that Joshua left unconquered when he died.",
      "22": "I did this to test Israel—to see whether or not they would follow the ways of the Lord as their ancestors did.”",
      "23": "That is why the Lord left those nations in place. He did not quickly drive them out or allow Joshua to conquer them all."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "These are the nations that the Lord left in the land to test those Israelites who had not experienced the wars of Canaan.",
      "2": "He did this to teach warfare to generations of Israelites who had no experience in battle.",
      "3": "These are the nations: the Philistines (those living under the five Philistine rulers), all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath.",
      "4": "These people were left to test the Israelites—to see whether they would obey the commands the Lord had given to their ancestors through Moses.",
      "5": "So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,",
      "6": "and they intermarried with them. Israelite sons married their daughters, and Israelite daughters were given in marriage to their sons. And the Israelites served their gods.",
      "7": "The Israelites did evil in the Lord’s sight. They forgot about the Lord their God, and they served the images of Baal and the Asherah poles.",
      "8": "Then the Lord burned with anger against Israel, and he turned them over to King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim. And the Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim for eight years.",
      "9": "But when the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help, the Lord raised up a rescuer to save them. His name was Othniel, the son of Caleb’s younger brother, Kenaz.",
      "10": "The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he became Israel’s judge. He went to war against King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram, and the Lord gave Othniel victory over him.",
      "11": "So there was peace in the land for forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.",
      "12": "Once again the Israelites did evil in the Lord’s sight, and the Lord gave King Eglon of Moab control over Israel because of their evil.",
      "13": "Eglon enlisted the Ammonites and Amalekites as allies, and then he went out and defeated Israel, taking possession of Jericho, the city of palms.",
      "14": "And the Israelites served Eglon of Moab for eighteen years.",
      "15": "But when the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help, the Lord again raised up a rescuer to save them. His name was Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed man of the tribe of Benjamin. The Israelites sent Ehud to deliver their tribute money to King Eglon of Moab.",
      "16": "So Ehud made a double-edged dagger that was about a foot long, and he strapped it to his right thigh, keeping it hidden under his clothing.",
      "17": "He brought the tribute money to Eglon, who was very fat.",
      "18": "After delivering the payment, Ehud started home with those who had helped carry the tribute.",
      "19": "But when Ehud reached the stone idols near Gilgal, he turned back. He came to Eglon and said, “I have a secret message for you.”\nSo the king commanded his servants, “Be quiet!” and he sent them all out of the room.",
      "20": "Ehud walked over to Eglon, who was sitting alone in a cool upstairs room. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you!” As King Eglon rose from his seat,",
      "21": "Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled out the dagger strapped to his right thigh, and plunged it into the king’s belly.",
      "22": "The dagger went so deep that the handle disappeared beneath the king’s fat. So Ehud did not pull out the dagger, and the king’s bowels emptied.",
      "23": "Then Ehud closed and locked the doors of the room and escaped down the latrine.",
      "24": "After Ehud was gone, the king’s servants returned and found the doors to the upstairs room locked. They thought he might be using the latrine in the room,",
      "25": "so they waited. But when the king didn’t come out after a long delay, they became concerned and got a key. And when they opened the doors, they found their master dead on the floor.",
      "26": "While the servants were waiting, Ehud escaped, passing the stone idols on his way to Seirah.",
      "27": "When he arrived in the hill country of Ephraim, Ehud sounded a call to arms. Then he led a band of Israelites down from the hills.",
      "28": "“Follow me,” he said, “for the Lord has given you victory over Moab your enemy.” So they followed him. And the Israelites took control of the shallow crossings of the Jordan River across from Moab, preventing anyone from crossing.",
      "29": "They attacked the Moabites and killed about 10,000 of their strongest and most able-bodied warriors. Not one of them escaped.",
      "30": "So Moab was conquered by Israel that day, and there was peace in the land for eighty years.",
      "31": "After Ehud, Shamgar son of Anath rescued Israel. He once killed 600 Philistines with an ox goad."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "After Ehud’s death, the Israelites again did evil in the Lord’s sight.",
      "2": "So the Lord turned them over to King Jabin of Hazor, a Canaanite king. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-haggoyim.",
      "3": "Sisera, who had 900 iron chariots, ruthlessly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years. Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help.",
      "4": "Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet who was judging Israel at that time.",
      "5": "She would sit under the Palm of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites would go to her for judgment.",
      "6": "One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam, who lived in Kedesh in the land of Naphtali. She said to him, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, commands you: Call out 10,000 warriors from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun at Mount Tabor.",
      "7": "And I will call out Sisera, commander of Jabin’s army, along with his chariots and warriors, to the Kishon River. There I will give you victory over him.”",
      "8": "Barak told her, “I will go, but only if you go with me.”",
      "9": "“Very well,” she replied, “I will go with you. But you will receive no honor in this venture, for the Lord’s victory over Sisera will be at the hands of a woman.” So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.",
      "10": "At Kedesh, Barak called together the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali, and 10,000 warriors went up with him. Deborah also went with him.",
      "11": "Now Heber the Kenite, a descendant of Moses’ brother-in-law Hobab, had moved away from the other members of his tribe and pitched his tent by the oak of Zaanannim near Kedesh.",
      "12": "When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,",
      "13": "he called for all 900 of his iron chariots and all of his warriors, and they marched from Harosheth-haggoyim to the Kishon River.",
      "14": "Then Deborah said to Barak, “Get ready! This is the day the Lord will give you victory over Sisera, for the Lord is marching ahead of you.” So Barak led his 10,000 warriors down the slopes of Mount Tabor into battle.",
      "15": "When Barak attacked, the Lord threw Sisera and all his chariots and warriors into a panic. Sisera leaped down from his chariot and escaped on foot.",
      "16": "Then Barak chased the chariots and the enemy army all the way to Harosheth-haggoyim, killing all of Sisera’s warriors. Not a single one was left alive.",
      "17": "Meanwhile, Sisera ran to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because Heber’s family was on friendly terms with King Jabin of Hazor.",
      "18": "Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come into my tent, sir. Come in. Don’t be afraid.” So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.",
      "19": "“Please give me some water,” he said. “I’m thirsty.” So she gave him some milk from a leather bag and covered him again.",
      "20": "“Stand at the door of the tent,” he told her. “If anybody comes and asks you if there is anyone here, say no.”",
      "21": "But when Sisera fell asleep from exhaustion, Jael quietly crept up to him with a hammer and tent peg in her hand. Then she drove the tent peg through his temple and into the ground, and so he died.",
      "22": "When Barak came looking for Sisera, Jael went out to meet him. She said, “Come, and I will show you the man you are looking for.” So he followed her into the tent and found Sisera lying there dead, with the tent peg through his temple.",
      "23": "So on that day Israel saw God defeat Jabin, the Canaanite king.",
      "24": "And from that time on Israel became stronger and stronger against King Jabin until they finally destroyed him."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:",
      "2": "“Israel’s leaders took charge,\n    and the people gladly followed.\nPraise the Lord!",
      "3": "“Listen, you kings!\n    Pay attention, you mighty rulers!\nFor I will sing to the Lord.\n    I will make music to the Lord, the God of Israel.",
      "4": "“Lord, when you set out from Seir\n    and marched across the fields of Edom,\nthe earth trembled,\n    and the cloudy skies poured down rain.",
      "5": "The mountains quaked in the presence of the Lord,\n    the God of Mount Sinai—\nin the presence of the Lord,\n    the God of Israel.",
      "6": "“In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,\n    and in the days of Jael,\npeople avoided the main roads,\n    and travelers stayed on winding pathways.",
      "7": "There were few people left in the villages of Israel—\n    until Deborah arose as a mother for Israel.",
      "8": "When Israel chose new gods,\n    war erupted at the city gates.\nYet not a shield or spear could be seen\n    among forty thousand warriors in Israel!",
      "9": "My heart is with the commanders of Israel,\n    with those who volunteered for war.\nPraise the Lord!",
      "10": "“Consider this, you who ride on fine donkeys,\n    you who sit on fancy saddle blankets,\n    and you who walk along the road.",
      "11": "Listen to the village musicians\n    gathered at the watering holes.\nThey recount the righteous victories of the Lord\n    and the victories of his villagers in Israel.\nThen the people of the Lord\n    marched down to the city gates.",
      "12": "“Wake up, Deborah, wake up!\n    Wake up, wake up, and sing a song!\nArise, Barak!\n    Lead your captives away, son of Abinoam!",
      "13": "“Down from Tabor marched the few against the nobles.\n    The people of the Lord marched down against mighty warriors.",
      "14": "They came down from Ephraim—\n    a land that once belonged to the Amalekites;\n    they followed you, Benjamin, with your troops.\nFrom Makir the commanders marched down;\n    from Zebulun came those who carry a commander’s staff.",
      "15": "The princes of Issachar were with Deborah and Barak.\n    They followed Barak, rushing into the valley.\nBut in the tribe of Reuben\n    there was great indecision.",
      "16": "Why did you sit at home among the sheepfolds—\n    to hear the shepherds whistle for their flocks?\nYes, in the tribe of Reuben\n    there was great indecision.",
      "17": "Gilead remained east of the Jordan.\n    And why did Dan stay home?\nAsher sat unmoved at the seashore,\n    remaining in his harbors.",
      "18": "But Zebulun risked his life,\n    as did Naphtali, on the heights of the battlefield.",
      "19": "“The kings of Canaan came and fought,\n    at Taanach near Megiddo’s springs,\n    but they carried off no silver treasures.",
      "20": "The stars fought from heaven.\n    The stars in their orbits fought against Sisera.",
      "21": "The Kishon River swept them away—\n    that ancient torrent, the Kishon.\nMarch on with courage, my soul!",
      "22": "Then the horses’ hooves hammered the ground,\n    the galloping, galloping of Sisera’s mighty steeds.",
      "23": "‘Let the people of Meroz be cursed,’ said the angel of the Lord.\n    ‘Let them be utterly cursed,\nbecause they did not come to help the Lord—\n    to help the Lord against the mighty warriors.’",
      "24": "“Most blessed among women is Jael,\n    the wife of Heber the Kenite.\n    May she be blessed above all women who live in tents.",
      "25": "Sisera asked for water,\n    and she gave him milk.\nIn a bowl fit for nobles,\n    she brought him yogurt.",
      "26": "Then with her left hand she reached for a tent peg,\n    and with her right hand for the workman’s hammer.\nShe struck Sisera with the hammer, crushing his head.\n    With a shattering blow, she pierced his temples.",
      "27": "He sank, he fell,\n    he lay still at her feet.\nAnd where he sank,\n    there he died.",
      "28": "“From the window Sisera’s mother looked out.\n    Through the window she watched for his return, saying,\n‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?\n    Why don’t we hear the sound of chariot wheels?’",
      "29": "“Her wise women answer,\n    and she repeats these words to herself:",
      "30": "‘They must be dividing the captured plunder—\n    with a woman or two for every man.\nThere will be colorful robes for Sisera,\n    and colorful, embroidered robes for me.\nYes, the plunder will include\n    colorful robes embroidered on both sides.’",
      "31": "“Lord, may all your enemies die like Sisera!\n    But may those who love you rise like the sun in all its power!”\nThen there was peace in the land for forty years."

      "1": "The Israelites did evil in the Lord’s sight. So the Lord handed them over to the Midianites for seven years.",
      "2": "The Midianites were so cruel that the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds.",
      "3": "Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, marauders from Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east would attack Israel,",
      "4": "camping in the land and destroying crops as far away as Gaza. They left the Israelites with nothing to eat, taking all the sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys.",
      "5": "These enemy hordes, coming with their livestock and tents, were as thick as locusts; they arrived on droves of camels too numerous to count. And they stayed until the land was stripped bare.",
      "6": "So Israel was reduced to starvation by the Midianites. Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord for help.",
      "7": "When they cried out to the Lord because of Midian,",

      "10": "I told you, ‘I am the Lord your God. You must not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you now live.’ But you have not listened to me.”",
      "11": "Then the angel of the Lord came and sat beneath the great tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash of the clan of Abiezer. Gideon son of Joash was threshing wheat at the bottom of a winepress to hide the grain from the Midianites.",
      "12": "The angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, “Mighty hero, the Lord is with you!”",
      "13": "“Sir,” Gideon replied, “if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? And where are all the miracles our ancestors told us about? Didn’t they say, ‘The Lord brought us up out of Egypt’? But now the Lord has abandoned us and handed us over to the Midianites.”",
      "14": "Then the Lord turned to him and said, “Go with the strength you have, and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I am sending you!”",
      "15": "“But Lord,” Gideon replied, “how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least in my entire family!”",
      "16": "The Lord said to him, “I will be with you. And you will destroy the Midianites as if you were fighting against one man.”",

      "18": "Don’t go away until I come back and bring my offering to you.”\nHe answered, “I will stay here until you return.”",
      "19": "Gideon hurried home. He cooked a young goat, and with a basket of flour he baked some bread without yeast. Then, carrying the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, he brought them out and presented them to the angel, who was under the great tree.",
      "20": "The angel of God said to him, “Place the meat and the unleavened bread on this rock, and pour the broth over it.” And Gideon did as he was told.",
      "21": "Then the angel of the Lord touched the meat and bread with the tip of the staff in his hand, and fire flamed up from the rock and consumed all he had brought. And the angel of the Lord disappeared.",
      "22": "When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the Lord, he cried out, “Oh, Sovereign Lord, I’m doomed! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face!”",
      "23": "“It is all right,” the Lord replied. “Do not be afraid. You will not die.”",
      "24": "And Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and named it Yahweh-Shalom (which means “the Lord is peace”). The altar remains in Ophrah in the land of the clan of Abiezer to this day.",
      "25": "That night the Lord said to Gideon, “Take the second bull from your father’s herd, the one that is seven years old. Pull down your father’s altar to Baal, and cut down the Asherah pole standing beside it.",
      "26": "Then build an altar to the Lord your God here on this hilltop sanctuary, laying the stones carefully. Sacrifice the bull as a burnt offering on the altar, using as fuel the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down.”",
      "27": "So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord had commanded. But he did it at night because he was afraid of the other members of his father’s household and the people of the town.",

In their place a new altar had been built, and on it were the remains of the bull that had been sacrificed.",

      "30": "“Bring out your son,” the men of the town demanded of Joash. “He must die for destroying the altar of Baal and for cutting down the Asherah pole.”",
      "31": "But Joash shouted to the mob that confronted him, “Why are you defending Baal? Will you argue his case? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If Baal truly is a god, let him defend himself and destroy the one who broke down his altar!”",
      "32": "From then on Gideon was called Jerub-baal, which means “Let Baal defend himself,” because he broke down Baal’s altar.",

      "37": "prove it to me in this way. I will put a wool fleece on the threshing floor tonight. If the fleece is wet with dew in the morning but the ground is dry, then I will know that you are going to help me rescue Israel as you promised.”",

      "5": "When Gideon took his warriors down to the water, the Lord told him, “Divide the men into two groups. In one group put all those who cup water in their hands and lap it up with their tongues like dogs. In the other group put all those who kneel down and drink with their mouths in the stream.”",

      "20": "Then all three groups blew their horns and broke their jars. They held the blazing torches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands, and they all shouted, “A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!”",
      "21": "Each man stood at his position around the camp and watched as all the Midianites rushed around in a panic, shouting as they ran to escape.",
      "22": "When the 300 Israelites blew their rams’ horns, the Lord caused the warriors in the camp to fight against each other with their swords. Those who were not killed fled to places as far away as Beth-shittah near Zererah and to the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath.",

Now tell me how you can be tied up securely.”\nSamson replied, “If you were to weave the seven braids of my hair into the fabric on your loom and tighten it with the loom shuttle, I would become as weak as anyone else.”\nSo while he slept, Delilah wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric.",

      "25": "The men of Dan said, “Watch what you say! There are some short-tempered men around here who might get angry and kill you and your family.”",
      "26": "So the men of Dan continued on their way. When Micah saw that there were too many of them for him to attack, he turned around and went home.",
      "27": "Then, with Micah’s idols and his priest, the men of Dan came to the town of Laish, whose people were peaceful and secure. They attacked with swords and burned the town to the ground.",
      "28": "There was no one to rescue the people, for they lived a great distance from Sidon and had no allies nearby. This happened in the valley near Beth-rehob.\nThen the people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the town and lived there.",
      "29": "They renamed the town Dan after their ancestor, Israel’s son, but it had originally been called Laish.",
      "30": "Then they set up the carved image, and they appointed Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses, as their priest. This family continued as priests for the tribe of Dan until the Exile.",
      "31": "So Micah’s carved image was worshiped by the tribe of Dan as long as the Tabernacle of God remained at Shiloh."

      "3": "her husband set out for Bethlehem to speak personally to her and persuade her to come back. He took with him a servant and a pair of donkeys. When he arrived at her father’s house, her father saw him and welcomed him.",
      "4": "Her father urged him to stay awhile, so he stayed three days, eating, drinking, and sleeping there.",
      "5": "On the fourth day the man was up early, ready to leave, but the woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Have something to eat before you go.”",
      "6": "So the two men sat down together and had something to eat and drink. Then the woman’s father said, “Please stay another night and enjoy yourself.”",
      "7": "The man got up to leave, but his father-in-law kept urging him to stay, so he finally gave in and stayed the night.",
      "8": "On the morning of the fifth day he was up early again, ready to leave, and again the woman’s father said, “Have something to eat; then you can leave later this afternoon.” So they had another day of feasting.",
      "9": "Later, as the man and his concubine and servant were preparing to leave, his father-in-law said, “Look, it’s almost evening. Stay the night and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow you can get up early and be on your way.”",

      "13": "Come on, let’s try to get as far as Gibeah or Ramah, and we’ll spend the night in one of those towns.”",

      "17": "When he saw the travelers sitting in the town square, he asked them where they were from and where they were going.",
      "18": "“We have been in Bethlehem in Judah,” the man replied. “We are on our way to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim, which is my home. I traveled to Bethlehem, and now I’m returning home. But no one has taken us in for the night,",
      "19": "even though we have everything we need. We have straw and feed for our donkeys and plenty of bread and wine for ourselves.”",
      "20": "“You are welcome to stay with me,” the old man said. “I will give you anything you might need. But whatever you do, don’t spend the night in the square.”",

      "23": "The old man stepped outside to talk to them. “No, my brothers, don’t do such an evil thing. For this man is a guest in my house, and such a thing would be shameful.",
      "24": "Here, take my virgin daughter and this man’s concubine. I will bring them out to you, and you can abuse them and do whatever you like. But don’t do such a shameful thing to this man.”",
      "25": "But they wouldn’t listen to him. So the Levite took hold of his concubine and pushed her out the door. The men of the town abused her all night, taking turns raping her until morning. Finally, at dawn they let her go.",
      "26": "At daybreak the woman returned to the house where her husband was staying. She collapsed at the door of the house and lay there until it was light.",
      "27": "When her husband opened the door to leave, there lay his concubine with her hands on the threshold.",
      "28": "He said, “Get up! Let’s go!” But there was no answer. So he put her body on his donkey and took her home.",
      "29": "When he got home, he took a knife and cut his concubine’s body into twelve pieces. Then he sent one piece to each tribe throughout all the territory of Israel.",
      "30": "Everyone who saw it said, “Such a horrible crime has not been committed in all the time since Israel left Egypt. Think about it! What are we going to do? Who’s going to speak up?”"

      "5": "That night some of the leading citizens of Gibeah surrounded the house, planning to kill me, and they raped my concubine until she was dead.",

      "7": "Now then, all of you—the entire community of Israel—must decide here and now what should be done about this!”",
      "8": "And all the people rose to their feet in unison and declared, “None of us will return home! No, not even one of us!",
      "9": "Instead, this is what we will do to Gibeah; we will draw lots to decide who will attack it.",
      "10": "One-tenth of the men from each tribe will be chosen to supply the warriors with food, and the rest of us will take revenge on Gibeah of Benjamin for this shameful thing they have done in Israel.”",
      "11": "So all the Israelites were completely united, and they gathered together to attack the town.",

      "13": "Give up those evil men, those troublemakers from Gibeah, so we can execute them and purge Israel of this evil.”\nBut the people of Benjamin would not listen.",

      "18": "Before the battle the Israelites went to Bethel and asked God, “Which tribe should go first to attack the people of Benjamin?”\nThe Lord answered, “Judah is to go first.”",

      "25": "but the men of Benjamin killed another 18,000 Israelites, all of whom were experienced with the sword.",
      "26": "Then all the Israelites went up to Bethel and wept in the presence of the Lord and fasted until evening. They also brought burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord.",

      "31": "When the men of Benjamin came out to attack, they were drawn away from the town. And as they had done before, they began to kill the Israelites. About thirty Israelites died in the open fields and along the roads, one leading to Bethel and the other leading back to Gibeah.",
      "32": "Then the warriors of Benjamin shouted, “We’re defeating them as we did before!” But the Israelites had planned in advance to run away so that the men of Benjamin would chase them along the roads and be drawn away from the town.",

      "36": "Then the men of Benjamin saw that they were beaten.\nThe Israelites had retreated from Benjamin’s warriors in order to give those hiding in ambush more room to maneuver against Gibeah.",
      "37": "Then those who were hiding rushed in from all sides and killed everyone in the town.",
      "38": "They had arranged to send up a large cloud of smoke from the town as a signal.",

      "41": "the men of Israel turned and attacked. At this point the men of Benjamin became terrified, because they realized disaster was close at hand.",
      "42": "So they turned around and fled before the Israelites toward the wilderness. But they couldn’t escape the battle, and the people who came out of the nearby towns were also killed.",
      "43": "The Israelites surrounded the men of Benjamin and chased them relentlessly, finally overtaking them east of Gibeah.",
      "44": "That day 18,000 of Benjamin’s strongest warriors died in battle.",
      "45": "The survivors fled into the wilderness toward the rock of Rimmon, but Israel killed 5,000 of them along the road. They continued the chase until they had killed another 2,000 near Gidom.",

      "4": "Early the next morning the people built an altar and presented their burnt offerings and peace offerings on it.",
      "5": "Then they said, “Who among the tribes of Israel did not join us at Mizpah when we held our assembly in the presence of the Lord?” At that time they had taken a solemn oath in the Lord’s presence, vowing that anyone who refused to come would be put to death.",

Let them have your daughters, for we didn’t find wives for all of them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not actually give your daughters to them in marriage.’”",
