      "7": "All the rivers run into the sea,\nYet the sea is not full;\nTo the place from which the rivers come,\nThere they return again.",
      "8": "All things are full of labor;\nMan cannot express it.\nThe eye is not satisfied with seeing,\nNor the ear filled with hearing.",
      "9": "That which has been is what will be,\nThat which is done is what will be done,\nAnd there is nothing new under the sun.",
      "10": "Is there anything of which it may be said,\n“See, this is new”?\nIt has already been in ancient times before us.",

      "14": "I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all is vanity and grasping for the wind.",
      "15": "What is crooked cannot be made straight,\nAnd what is lacking cannot be numbered.",
      "16": "I communed with my heart, saying, “Look, I have attained greatness, and have gained more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My heart has understood great wisdom and knowledge.”",
      "17": "And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is grasping for the wind.",

      "3": "I searched in my heart how to gratify my flesh with wine, while guiding my heart with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives.",
      "4": "I made my works great, I built myself houses, and planted myself vineyards.",

      "15": "So I said in my heart,\n“As it happens to the fool,\nIt also happens to me,\nAnd why was I then more wise?”\nThen I said in my heart,\n“This also is vanity.”",

      "19": "And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.",
      "20": "Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun.",
      "21": "For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet he must leave his heritage to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.",
      "22": "For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun?",
      "23": "For all his days are sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.",
      "24": "Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God.",
      "25": "For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?",
      "26": "For God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who is good in His sight; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting, that he may give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind."

      "21": "Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth?",
