      "9": "Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength,\nAnd it was boundless;\nPut and Lubim were your helpers.",
      "10": "Yet she was carried away,\nShe went into captivity;\nHer young children also were dashed to pieces\nAt the head of every street;\nThey cast lots for her honorable men,\nAnd all her great men were bound in chains.",
