    "1": {
      "1": "The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi.",
      "2": "“I have loved you,” says the Lord.\n“Yet you say, ‘In what way have You loved us?’\nWas not Esau Jacob’s brother?”\nSays the Lord.\n“Yet Jacob I have loved;",
      "3": "But Esau I have hated,\nAnd laid waste his mountains and his heritage\nFor the jackals of the wilderness.”",
      "4": "Even though Edom has said,\n“We have been impoverished,\nBut we will return and build the desolate places,”\nThus says the Lord of hosts:\n“They may build, but I will throw down;\nThey shall be called the Territory of Wickedness,\nAnd the people against whom the Lord will have indignation forever.",
      "5": "Your eyes shall see,\nAnd you shall say,\n‘The Lord is magnified beyond the border of Israel.’",
      "6": "“A son honors his father,\nAnd a servant his master.\nIf then I am the Father,\nWhere is My honor?\nAnd if I am a Master,\nWhere is My reverence?\nSays the Lord of hosts\nTo you priests who despise My name.\nYet you say, ‘In what way have we despised Your name?’",
      "7": "“You offer defiled food on My altar,\nBut say,\n‘In what way have we defiled You?’\nBy saying,\n‘The table of the Lord is contemptible.’",
      "8": "And when you offer the blind as a sacrifice,\nIs it not evil?\nAnd when you offer the lame and sick,\nIs it not evil?\nOffer it then to your governor!\nWould he be pleased with you?\nWould he accept you favorably?”\nSays the Lord of hosts.",
      "9": "“But now entreat God’s favor,\nThat He may be gracious to us.\nWhile this is being done by your hands,\nWill He accept you favorably?”\nSays the Lord of hosts.",
      "10": "“Who is there even among you who would shut the doors,\nSo that you would not kindle fire on My altar in vain?\nI have no pleasure in you,”\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n“Nor will I accept an offering from your hands.",
      "11": "For from the rising of the sun, even to its going down,\nMy name shall be great among the Gentiles;\nIn every place incense shall be offered to My name,\nAnd a pure offering;\nFor My name shall be great among the nations,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.",
      "12": "“But you profane it,\nIn that you say,\n‘The table of the Lord is defiled;\nAnd its fruit, its food, is contemptible.’",
      "13": "You also say,\n‘Oh, what a weariness!’\nAnd you sneer at it,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.\n“And you bring the stolen, the lame, and the sick;\nThus you bring an offering!\nShould I accept this from your hand?”\nSays the Lord.",
      "14": "“But cursed be the deceiver\nWho has in his flock a male,\nAnd takes a vow,\nBut sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished—\nFor I am a great King,”\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n“And My name is to be feared among the nations."

    "2": {
      "1": "“And now, O priests, this commandment is for you.",
      "2": "If you will not hear,\nAnd if you will not take it to heart,\nTo give glory to My name,”\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n“I will send a curse upon you,\nAnd I will curse your blessings.\nYes, I have cursed them already,\nBecause you do not take it to heart.",
      "3": "“Behold, I will rebuke your descendants\nAnd spread refuse on your faces,\nThe refuse of your solemn feasts;\nAnd one will take you away with it.",
      "4": "Then you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you,\nThat My covenant with Levi may continue,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.",
      "5": "“My covenant was with him, one of life and peace,\nAnd I gave them to him that he might fear Me;\nSo he feared Me\nAnd was reverent before My name.",
      "6": "The law of truth was in his mouth,\nAnd injustice was not found on his lips.\nHe walked with Me in peace and equity,\nAnd turned many away from iniquity.",
      "7": "“For the lips of a priest should keep knowledge,\nAnd people should seek the law from his mouth;\nFor he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.",
      "8": "But you have departed from the way;\nYou have caused many to stumble at the law.\nYou have corrupted the covenant of Levi,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.",
      "9": "“Therefore I also have made you contemptible and base\nBefore all the people,\nBecause you have not kept My ways\nBut have shown partiality in the law.”",
      "10": "Have we not all one Father?\nHas not one God created us?\nWhy do we deal treacherously with one another\nBy profaning the covenant of the fathers?",
      "11": "Judah has dealt treacherously,\nAnd an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem,\nFor Judah has profaned\nThe Lord’s holy institution which He loves:\nHe has married the daughter of a foreign god.",
      "12": "May the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob\nThe man who does this, being awake and aware,\nYet who brings an offering to the Lord of hosts!",
      "13": "And this is the second thing you do:\nYou cover the altar of the Lord with tears,\nWith weeping and crying;\nSo He does not regard the offering anymore,\nNor receive it with goodwill from your hands.",
      "14": "Yet you say, “For what reason?”\nBecause the Lord has been witness\nBetween you and the wife of your youth,\nWith whom you have dealt treacherously;\nYet she is your companion\nAnd your wife by covenant.",
      "15": "But did He not make them one,\nHaving a remnant of the Spirit?\nAnd why one?\nHe seeks godly offspring.\nTherefore take heed to your spirit,\nAnd let none deal treacherously with the wife of his youth.",
      "16": "“For the Lord God of Israel says\nThat He hates divorce,\nFor it covers one’s garment with violence,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.\n“Therefore take heed to your spirit,\nThat you do not deal treacherously.”",
      "17": "You have wearied the Lord with your words;\nYet you say,\n“In what way have we wearied Him?”\nIn that you say,\n“Everyone who does evil\nIs good in the sight of the Lord,\nAnd He delights in them,”\nOr, “Where is the God of justice?”"

      "1": "“Behold, I send My messenger,\nAnd he will prepare the way before Me.\nAnd the Lord, whom you seek,\nWill suddenly come to His temple,\nEven the Messenger of the covenant,\nIn whom you delight.\nBehold, He is coming,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.",
      "2": "“But who can endure the day of His coming?\nAnd who can stand when He appears?\nFor He is like a refiner’s fire\nAnd like launderers’ soap.",
      "3": "He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver;\nHe will purify the sons of Levi,\nAnd purge them as gold and silver,\nThat they may offer to the Lord\nAn offering in righteousness.",
      "4": "“Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem\nWill be pleasant to the Lord,\nAs in the days of old,\nAs in former years.",
      "5": "And I will come near you for judgment;\nI will be a swift witness\nAgainst sorcerers,\nAgainst adulterers,\nAgainst perjurers,\nAgainst those who exploit wage earners and widows and orphans,\nAnd against those who turn away an alien—\nBecause they do not fear Me,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.",
      "6": "“For I am the Lord, I do not change;\nTherefore you are not consumed, O sons of Jacob.",
      "7": "Yet from the days of your fathers\nYou have gone away from My ordinances\nAnd have not kept them.\nReturn to Me, and I will return to you,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.\n“But you said,\n‘In what way shall we return?’",
      "8": "“Will a man rob God?\nYet you have robbed Me!\nBut you say,\n‘In what way have we robbed You?’\nIn tithes and offerings.",
      "9": "You are cursed with a curse,\nFor you have robbed Me,\nEven this whole nation.",
      "10": "Bring all the tithes into the storehouse,\nThat there may be food in My house,\nAnd try Me now in this,”\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n“If I will not open for you the windows of heaven\nAnd pour out for you such blessing\nThat there will not be room enough to receive it.",
      "11": "“And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes,\nSo that he will not destroy the fruit of your ground,\nNor shall the vine fail to bear fruit for you in the field,”\nSays the Lord of hosts;",
      "12": "“And all nations will call you blessed,\nFor you will be a delightful land,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.",
      "13": "“Your words have been harsh against Me,”\nSays the Lord,\n“Yet you say,\n‘What have we spoken against You?’",
      "14": "You have said,\n‘It is useless to serve God;\nWhat profit is it that we have kept His ordinance,\nAnd that we have walked as mourners\nBefore the Lord of hosts?",
      "15": "So now we call the proud blessed,\nFor those who do wickedness are raised up;\nThey even tempt God and go free.’ ”",
      "16": "Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another,\nAnd the Lord listened and heard them;\nSo a book of remembrance was written before Him\nFor those who fear the Lord\nAnd who meditate on His name.",
      "17": "“They shall be Mine,” says the Lord of hosts,\n“On the day that I make them My jewels.\nAnd I will spare them\nAs a man spares his own son who serves him.”",
      "18": "Then you shall again discern\nBetween the righteous and the wicked,\nBetween one who serves God\nAnd one who does not serve Him."

    "4": {
      "1": "“For behold, the day is coming,\nBurning like an oven,\nAnd all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble.\nAnd the day which is coming shall burn them up,”\nSays the Lord of hosts,\n“That will leave them neither root nor branch.",
      "2": "But to you who fear My name\nThe Sun of Righteousness shall arise\nWith healing in His wings;\nAnd you shall go out\nAnd grow fat like stall-fed calves.",
      "3": "You shall trample the wicked,\nFor they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet\nOn the day that I do this,”\nSays the Lord of hosts.",
      "4": "“Remember the Law of Moses, My servant,\nWhich I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel,\nWith the statutes and judgments.",
      "5": "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet\nBefore the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.",
      "6": "And he will turn\nThe hearts of the fathers to the children,\nAnd the hearts of the children to their fathers,\nLest I come and strike the earth with a curse.”"
