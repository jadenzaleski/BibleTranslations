      "1": "There was a certain man from Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim. His name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.",
      "2": "He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah. The name of the other was Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.",
      "3": "This man would go from his city each year to worship and to give gifts on the altar in Shiloh to the Lord of All. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were the Lord’s religious leaders there.",
      "4": "On the day when Elkanah killed animals on the altar in worship, he would give part of the gift to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.",
      "5": "But he would give twice as much to Hannah, for he loved Hannah. But the Lord had made it so she could not have children.",
      "6": "Peninnah would try to make her very angry, because the Lord would not let her have children.",
      "7": "So it happened, year after year, each time Hannah went up to the house of the Lord, Peninnah would make her angry. Hannah cried and would not eat.",
      "8": "Then her husband Elkanah said to her, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why are you not eating, and why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "Then Hannah stood up after they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh. Eli the religious leader was sitting on the seat by the door of the house of the Lord.",
      "10": "Hannah was very troubled. She prayed to the Lord and cried with sorrow.",
      "11": "Then she made a promise and said, “O Lord of All, be sure to look on the trouble of Your woman servant, and remember me. Do not forget Your woman servant, but give me a son. If You will, then I will give him to the Lord all his life. And no hair will ever be cut from his head.”",
      "12": "While she kept praying to the Lord, Eli was watching her mouth.",
      "13": "Hannah was speaking in her heart. Her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she had drunk too much.",
      "14": "Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put wine away from you.”",
      "15": "But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have not drunk wine or strong drink, but I was pouring out my soul to the Lord.",
      "16": "Do not think of your woman servant as a woman of no worth. For I have been speaking out of much trouble and pain in my spirit.”",
      "17": "Then Eli answered, “Go in peace. May the God of Israel do what you have asked of Him.”",
      "18": "And Hannah said, “Let your woman servant find favor in your eyes.” So she went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.",
      "19": "The family got up early in the morning and worshiped before the Lord. Then they returned to their house in Ramah. Elkanah lay with his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her.",
      "20": "The Lord made it possible for her to have a child, and when the time came she gave birth to a son. She gave him the name Samuel, saying, “I have asked the Lord for him.”",
      "21": "Then Elkanah went up with all those of his house to give the Lord the gift on the altar in worship as he did each year, and to pay what he had promised.",
      "22": "But Hannah did not go. For she said to her husband, “I will not go up until the child no longer needs to be nursed. Then I will bring him before the Lord, to stay there forever.”",
      "23": "Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what you think is best. Stay here until he no longer needs to be nursed. Only may the Lord do as He has said.” So Hannah stayed and nursed her son until he no longer needed to be nursed.",
      "24": "When she had finished nursing him, she took him with her to the house of the Lord in Shiloh, and the child was young.",
      "25": "She brought a three year old bull, one basket of flour and a jar of wine also. Then they killed the bull, and brought the boy to Eli.",
      "26": "Hannah said, “O, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the Lord.",
      "27": "I prayed for this boy, and the Lord has given me what I asked of Him.",
      "28": "So I have given him to the Lord. He is given to the Lord as long as he lives.” And they worshiped the Lord there."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Then Hannah prayed and said, “My heart is happy in the Lord. My strength is honored in the Lord. My mouth speaks with strength against those who hate me, because I have joy in Your saving power.",
      "2": "There is no one holy like the Lord. For sure, there is no one other than You. There is no rock like our God.",
      "3": "Speak no more in your pride. Do not let proud talk come out of your mouth. For the Lord is a God Who knows. Actions are weighed by Him.",
      "4": "The bows of the powerful are broken. But the weak are dressed in strength.",
      "5": "Those who were full go out to work for bread. But those who were hungry are filled. She who could not give birth has given birth to seven. But she who has many children has become weak.",
      "6": "The Lord kills and brings to life. He brings down to the grave, and He raises up.",
      "7": "The Lord makes poor and makes rich. He brings low and He lifts up.",
      "8": "He lifts the poor from the dust. He lifts those in need from the ashes. He makes them sit with rulers and receive a seat of honor. For what holds the earth belongs to the Lord. He has set the world in its place.",
      "9": "He watches over the steps of His good people. But the sinful ones will be made quiet in darkness. For a man will not win by strength.",
      "10": "Those who fight with the Lord will be broken to pieces. He will thunder in heaven against them. The Lord will decide about all people to the ends of the earth. He will give strength to His king. He will give power to His chosen one.”",
      "11": "Elkanah went home to Ramah. But the boy served the Lord with Eli the religious leader.",
      "12": "The sons of Eli were men of no worth. They did not know the Lord.",
      "13": "This is the way the religious leaders acted toward the people. When any man brought an animal to give to the Lord, the religious leader’s servant would come with a meat-hook in his hand, while the meat was hot.",
      "14": "Then he would put it in the pot. The religious leader would take for himself all that the meat-hook brought up. They did this to all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.",
      "15": "And before they burned the fat, the religious leader’s servant would come and say to the man who brought the gift in worship, “Give meat for the religious leader to make ready. For he will not take boiled meat from you, but only meat that has just been killed.”",
      "16": "But if the man says to him, “Let them burn the fat first, then take as much as you want,” then the religious leader’s servant would say, “No, give it to me now; and if not, I will take it from you against your will.”",
      "17": "So the sin of the young men was very bad before the Lord. For the men hated the gift of the Lord.",
      "18": "Now Samuel was serving the Lord, even as a boy, wearing a linen vest.",
      "19": "Each year his mother would make him a little coat. She would bring it to him when she came with her husband to bring the gift in worship each year.",
      "20": "Then Eli would pray that good would come to Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the Lord give you children from this woman in place of the one she gave to the Lord.” Then they would return to their home.",
      "21": "And the Lord visited Hannah. She gave birth to three sons and two daughters. The boy Samuel grew up to serve the Lord.",
      "22": "Now Eli was very old. He heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the door of the meeting tent.",
      "23": "And he said to them, “Why do you do such things, the sinful things I hear from all these people?",
      "24": "No, my sons, the news is not good which I hear from the Lord’s people.",
      "25": "If one man sins against another, God will help make peace for him. But if a man sins against the Lord, who can make peace for him?” Yet they would not listen to what their father said, for it was the Lord’s will to kill them.",
      "26": "Now the boy Samuel grew and was in favor both with the Lord and with men.",
      "27": "Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lord says. ‘Did I not let Myself be known to those of your father’s family when they were in Egypt being made to work for Pharaoh’s house?",
      "28": "Did I not choose them from all the families of Israel to be My religious leaders, to go up to My altar, to burn special perfume, and to wear a linen vest before Me? Did I not give all the gifts made by fire of the people of Israel to the family of your father?",
      "29": "Why do you show no respect to My gifts which I have asked for, and honor your sons more than Me? You make yourselves fat with the best part of every gift given in worship by My people Israel.’",
      "30": "So the Lord God of Israel says, ‘I did promise that those of your family and the family of your father should walk before Me forever.’ But now the Lord says, ‘May this be far from Me. For I will honor those who honor Me. And those who hate Me will not be honored.",
      "31": "See, the days are coming when I will break your strength and the strength of your father’s family. So there will not be an old man in your family.",
      "32": "You will see the trouble of My family, even in all the good I do for Israel. And an old man will not be in your family forever.",
      "33": "But I will not destroy every man of yours from My altar. Some will be left to cry and be filled with sorrow. But all the children of your family will die in their best years.",
      "34": "This will be the special thing that you will see. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will both die on the same day.",
      "35": "I will raise up for Myself a faithful religious leader who will act by what is in My heart and mind. I will build him a family to last. And he will walk before My chosen one forever.",
      "36": "Everyone who is left in your family will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and say, “I beg you, put me in one of the religious leader’s places so that I may eat a piece of bread.”’”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Now the boy Samuel was working for the Lord with Eli. There were few words from the Lord given in those days, and there were not many special dreams.",
      "2": "At that time Eli was lying down in his own place. His eyes had become weak and he could not see well.",
      "3": "The lamp of God had not gone out yet. And Samuel was lying down in the house of the Lord where the special box of God was.",
      "4": "Then the Lord called Samuel, and Samuel said, “Here I am.”",
      "5": "He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli said, “I did not call you. Lie down again.” So Samuel went and lay down.",
      "6": "The Lord called again, “Samuel!” So Samuel got up and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli answered, “I did not call you, my son. Lie down again.”",
      "7": "Now Samuel did not know the Lord yet. And the Word of the Lord had not been made known to him.",
      "8": "The Lord called Samuel again for the third time. He got up and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli understood that the Lord was calling the boy.",
      "9": "Eli said to Samuel, “Go lie down. If He calls you, say, ‘Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.",
      "10": "Then the Lord came and stood and called as He did the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.”",
      "11": "The Lord said to Samuel, “See, I am about to do a thing in Israel which will make both ears of everyone who hears it feel strange.",
      "12": "On that day I will do all I have said I will do against the family of Eli.",
      "13": "I have told him that I will punish his family forever for the sin he knew about. Because his sons brought the sin upon themselves, and Eli did not stop them.",
      "14": "So I swear to the family of Eli that the sin of his family will not be paid for with gifts given on the altar forever.”",
      "15": "Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the Lord. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the special dream.",
      "16": "Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And Samuel said, “Here I am.”",
      "17": "Eli said, “What did the Lord tell you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more, if you hide anything from me of all He said to you.”",
      "18": "So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And Eli said, “It is the Lord. Let Him do what is good in His eyes.”",
      "19": "Samuel grew. And the Lord was with him and made everything he said come true.",
      "20": "All Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel had become a man of God.",
      "21": "The Lord came again to Shiloh. For the Lord made Himself known to Samuel at Shiloh, by the Word of the Lord."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "So the news of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines. They set up their tents beside Ebenezer while the Philistines stayed at Aphek.",
      "2": "The Philistines came dressed for battle to meet Israel. When the battle spread, Israel lost to the Philistines. The Philistines killed about 4,000 men on the battle-field.",
      "3": "When the people returned to the tents, the leaders of Israel said, “Why has the Lord made us lose today to the Philistines? Let us bring the special box that holds the Law of the Lord here from Shiloh. Then He may come among us and save us from the power of those who fight against us.”",
      "4": "So the people sent men to Shiloh to take the special box with the Law of the Lord of All Who sits above the cherubim. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the special box with the Law of God.",
      "5": "When the box with the Law of the Lord came among the tents, all Israel called out with a loud noise, so that the earth shook.",
      "6": "When the Philistines heard the noise, they said, “What does this loud noise among the Hebrews mean?” Then they understood that the special box of the Lord had come among the Israelites.",
      "7": "The Philistines were afraid. They said, “A god has come among the tents. Trouble has come to us! Nothing like this has happened before.",
      "8": "Trouble has come to us! Who will save us from the hand of these powerful gods? These are the gods who destroyed the Egyptians with all kinds of troubles in the desert.",
      "9": "Be strong and act like men, O Philistines. Or you will be made to work for the Hebrews, as they have been made to work for you. Be men and fight.”",
      "10": "So the Philistines fought, and Israel lost. Every man ran to his tent. And many were killed, for 30,000 foot soldiers of Israel fell.",
      "11": "The special box of God was taken. And Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.",
      "12": "A man of Benjamin ran from the battle and came to Shiloh the same day. His clothes were torn and he had dust on his head.",
      "13": "When he came, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for he was very worried about the special box of God. The man told the news in the city, and all the city cried out.",
      "14": "When Eli heard the noise in the city, he said, “What does this noise mean?” Then the man came in a hurry and told Eli.",
      "15": "Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were weak so that he could not see.",
      "16": "The man said to Eli, “I have come from the battle. I ran from the battle today.” And Eli said, “How did it go, my son?”",
      "17": "The one who brought the news answered, “Israel has run from the Philistines and there have been many people killed. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead. And the special box of God has been taken.”",
      "18": "When he told about the special box of God, Eli fell back off the seat by the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.",
      "19": "Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was going to have a child and about to give birth. When she heard the news that the special box of God was taken and that her father-in-law and husband had died, she started to give birth, for her pains came upon her.",
      "20": "About the time of her death, the women who stood by her said to her, “Do not be afraid. For you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer or listen to them.",
      "21": "She gave the boy the name Ichabod, saying, “The honor has left Israel,” because the special box of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and husband.",
      "22": "She said, “The honor has left Israel, for the special box of God was taken.”"

    "5": {
      "1": "The Philistines took the special box of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.",
      "2": "They took the special box of God into the house of Dagon, and set it beside Dagon.",
      "3": "When the Ashdodites got up early the next morning, they saw that Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the special box of the Lord. So they took Dagon and set him in his place again.",
      "4": "But when they got up early the next morning, they saw that Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground in front of the special box of the Lord. And Dagon’s head and both his hands were cut off and lying in the doorway. Only the body of Dagon was left.",
      "5": "So the religious leaders of Dagon and all who go into Dagon’s house do not step on the bottom part of the doorway in Ashdod to this day.",
      "6": "The hand of the Lord was heavy on the Ashdodites. He filled them with fear and punished them with pain and sores, both Ashdod and its lands.",
      "7": "When the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, “The special box of the God of Israel must not stay with us. For His hand is hard on us and on our god Dagon.”",
      "8": "So they called together all the leaders of the Philistines and said, “What should we do with the special box of the God of Israel?” And they said, “Let the special box of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” So they brought the box of the God of Israel there.",
      "9": "But after they had brought it there, the hand of the Lord was against the city, causing much fear. He punished both the young and old men of the city, so that sores broke out upon them.",
      "10": "So they sent the special box of God to Ekron. When the box of God came to Ekron, the people there cried out, “They have brought the special box of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.”",
      "11": "So they called together all the leaders of the Philistines and said, “Send away the special box of the God of Israel. Let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people.” For the people of the city were afraid. The hand of God was very heavy there.",
      "12": "The men who did not die were punished with sores, and the cry of the city went up to heaven."

      "1": "The special box of the Lord had been in the country of the Philistines seven months.",
      "2": "The Philistines called for the religious leaders and those who were wise in secret ways, saying, “What should we do with the special box of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it to its place.”",
      "3": "And they said, “If you send away the special box of the God of Israel, do not send it empty. But be sure to return to Him a sin gift. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand does not turn away from you.”",
      "4": "Then they said, “What should we return to Him for a sin gift?” And they said, “Five sores made of gold and five gold mice, as many as there are Philistine leaders. For the same trouble was upon all of you and on your leaders.",
      "5": "So make objects to look like your sores and your mice that destroyed the land, and you will give honor to the God of Israel. It may be that He will be easier on you, your gods, and your land.",
      "6": "Why do you make your hearts hard as the Egyptians and Pharaoh made their hearts hard? Do not forget how the God of Israel made it hard for them. And did they not let the people go?",
      "7": "So now take and make ready a new wagon and two milk cows that have never pulled a load. Tie the cows to the wagon and take their calves away from them.",
      "8": "Take the special box of the Lord and put it on the wagon. Put the objects of gold which you return to Him as a sin gift in a box by its side. Then send it away, and let it be gone.",
      "9": "And watch. If it goes on the way to its own land, to Bethshemesh, then He has done this very bad thing to us. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that destroyed us. It will have just happened for no reason.”",
      "10": "The men did so. They took two milk cows and tied them to the wagon, and shut up their calves at home.",
      "11": "They put the special box of the Lord on the wagon, and the box with the gold mice and the objects made to look like their sores.",
      "12": "And the cows went straight toward Bethshemesh. They went along the straight road, making a sound as they went. They did not turn aside to the right or to the left. And the leaders of the Philistines followed them to the outside of Bethshemesh.",
      "13": "Now the people of Bethshemesh were gathering their grain in the valley. They looked up and saw the special box of the Lord, and were glad to see it.",
      "14": "The wagon came into the field of Joshua the Bethshemite and stopped there by a big stone. They cut the wood of the wagon into pieces and gave the cows as a burnt gift to the Lord.",
      "15": "The Levites took down the special box of the Lord and the box that was with it that had the objects of gold, and put them on the big stone. The men of Bethshemesh gave burnt gifts in worship that day to the Lord.",
      "16": "When the five leaders of the Philistines saw it, they returned that day to Ekron.",
      "17": "These are the sores made of gold which the Philistines returned for a sin gift to the Lord. There was one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.",
      "18": "And the gold mice were as many as the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five leaders, both cities with walls and country towns. The big stone where they set the special box of the Lord is there in the field of Joshua the Bethshemite to this day.",
      "19": "The Lord killed some of the men of Bethshemesh because they had looked into the special box of the Lord. He killed 70 (50,070) men. And the people were filled with sorrow because the Lord had killed so many of them.",
      "20": "The men of Bethshemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the Lord, this holy God? To whom can we send Him?”",

      "3": "Then Samuel said to all the family of Israel, “Return to the Lord with all your heart. Put away the strange gods and the false goddess Ashtaroth from among you. Turn your hearts to the Lord and worship Him alone. Then He will save you from the Philistines.”",
