      "12": "The followers went back to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is close to Jerusalem.",
      "13": "When they came into the city, they went up to a room on the second floor where they stayed. The followers were Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Canaanite, and Judas the brother of James.",
      "14": "These all agreed as they prayed together. The women and Mary the mother of Jesus and His brothers were there.",
