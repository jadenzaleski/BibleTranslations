      "3": "Let us honor and thank the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He has already given us a taste of what heaven is like.",
      "4": "Even before the world was made, God chose us for Himself because of His love. He planned that we should be holy and without blame as He sees us.",
      "5": "God already planned to have us as His own children. This was done by Jesus Christ. In His plan God wanted this done.",
      "6": "We thank God for His loving-favor to us. He gave this loving-favor to us through His much-loved Son.",
      "7": "Because of the blood of Christ, we are bought and made free from the punishment of sin. And because of His blood, our sins are forgiven. His loving-favor to us is so rich.",
      "8": "He was so willing to give all of this to us. He did this with wisdom and understanding.",
      "9": "God told us the secret of what He wanted to do. It is this: In loving thought He planned long ago to send Christ into the world.",
      "10": "The plan was for Christ to gather us all together at the right time. If we are in heaven or still on earth, He will bring us together and will be head over all.",
      "11": "We were already chosen to be God’s own children by Christ. This was done just like the plan He had.",
      "12": "We who were the first to put our trust in Christ should thank Him for His greatness.",
      "13": "The truth is the Good News. When you heard the truth, you put your trust in Christ. Then God marked you by giving you His Holy Spirit as a promise.",
      "14": "The Holy Spirit was given to us as a promise that we will receive everything God has for us. God’s Spirit will be with us until God finishes His work of making us complete. God does this to show His shining-greatness.",
      "15": "I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all Christians.",
      "16": "Since then, I always give thanks for you and pray for you.",

      "18": "I pray that your hearts will be able to understand. I pray that you will know about the hope given by God’s call. I pray that you will see how great the things are that He has promised to those who belong to Him.",
      "19": "I pray that you will know how great His power is for those who have put their trust in Him.",
      "20": "It is the same power that raised Christ from the dead. This same power put Christ at God’s right side in heaven.",
      "21": "This place was given to Christ. It is much greater than any king or leader can have. No one else can have this place of honor and power. No one in this world or in the world to come can have such honor and power.",

      "3": "At one time all of us lived to please our old selves. We gave in to what our bodies and minds wanted. We were sinful from birth like all other people and would suffer from the anger of God.",
      "4": "But God had so much loving-kindness. He loved us with such a great love.",
      "5": "Even when we were dead because of our sins, He made us alive by what Christ did for us. You have been saved from the punishment of sin by His loving-favor.",
      "6": "God raised us up from death when He raised up Christ Jesus. He has given us a place with Christ in the heavens.",
      "7": "He did this to show us through all the time to come the great riches of His loving-favor. He has shown us His kindness through Christ Jesus.",
      "8": "For by His loving-favor you have been saved from the punishment of sin through faith. It is not by anything you have done. It is a gift of God.",
      "9": "It is not given to you because you worked for it. If you could work for it, you would be proud.",
      "10": "We are His work. He has made us to belong to Christ Jesus so we can work for Him. He planned that we should do this.",
      "11": "Do not forget that at one time you did not know God. The Jews, who had gone through the religious act of becoming a Jew by man’s hands, said you were people who do not know God.",
      "12": "You were living without Christ then. The Jewish people who belonged to God had nothing to do with you. The promises He gave to them were not for you. You had nothing in this world to hope for. You were without God.",
      "13": "But now you belong to Christ Jesus. At one time you were far away from God. Now you have been brought close to Him. Christ did this for you when He gave His blood on the cross.",
      "14": "We have peace because of Christ. He has made the Jews and those who are not Jews one people. He broke down the wall that divided them.",
      "15": "He stopped the fighting between them by His death on the cross. He put an end to the Law. Then He made of the two people one new kind of people like Himself. In this way, He made peace.",
      "16": "He brought both groups together to God. Christ finished the fighting between them by His death on the cross.",
      "17": "Then Christ came and preached the Good News of peace to you who were far away from God. And He preached it to us who were near God.",
      "18": "Now all of us can go to the Father through Christ by way of the one Holy Spirit.",
      "19": "From now on you are not strangers and people who are not citizens. You are citizens together with those who belong to God. You belong in God’s family.",
      "20": "This family is built on the teachings of the missionaries and the early preachers. Jesus Christ Himself is the cornerstone, which is the most important part of the building.",
      "21": "Christ keeps this building together and it is growing into a holy building for the Lord.",

      "5": "Long ago men did not know these things. But now they have been shown to His missionaries and to the early preachers by the Holy Spirit.",
      "6": "Let me tell you that the Good News is for the people who are not Jews also. They are able to have life that lasts forever. They are to be a part of His church and family, together with the Jews. And together they are to receive all that God has promised through Christ.",
      "7": "God asked me to preach this Good News. He gave me the gift of His loving-favor. He gave me His power to preach it.",
      "8": "Of all those who belong to Christ, I am the least important. But this loving-favor was given to me to preach to the people who are not Jews. I was to tell them of the great riches in Christ which do not come to an end.",
      "9": "I was to make all men understand the meaning of this secret. God kept this secret to Himself from the beginning of the world. And He is the One Who made all things.",
      "10": "This was done so the great wisdom of God might be shown now to the leaders and powers in the heavenly places. It is being done through the church.",
      "11": "This was the plan God had for all time. He did this through Christ Jesus our Lord.",
      "12": "We can come to God without fear because we have put our trust in Christ.",
      "13": "So I ask you not to lose heart because of my suffering for you. It is to help you.",

      "19": "I pray that you will know the love of Christ. His love goes beyond anything we can understand. I pray that you will be filled with God Himself.",
      "20": "God is able to do much more than we ask or think through His power working in us.",

      "9": "When they say, “He went up,” what does it mean but that He had first gone down to the deep parts of the earth?",
      "10": "Christ Who went down into the deep also went up far above the heavens. He did this to fill all the world with Himself.",
      "11": "Christ gave gifts to men. He gave to some the gift to be missionaries, some to be preachers, others to be preachers who go from town to town. He gave others the gift to be church leaders and teachers.",
      "12": "These gifts help His people work well for Him. And then the church which is the body of Christ will be made strong.",
      "13": "All of us are to be as one in the faith and in knowing the Son of God. We are to be full-grown Christians standing as high and complete as Christ is Himself.",
      "14": "Then we will not be as children any longer. Children are like boats thrown up and down on big waves. They are blown with the wind. False teaching is like the wind. False teachers try everything possible to make people believe a lie,",
      "15": "but we are to hold to the truth with love in our hearts. We are to grow up and be more like Christ. He is the leader of the church.",
      "16": "Christ has put each part of the church in its right place. Each part helps other parts. This is what is needed to keep the whole body together. In this way, the whole body grows strong in love.",
      "17": "I tell you this in the name of the Lord: You must not live any longer like the people of the world who do not know God. Their thoughts are foolish.",
      "18": "Their minds are in darkness. They are strangers to the life of God. This is because they have closed their minds to Him and have turned their hearts away from Him.",
      "19": "They do not care anymore about what is right or wrong. They have turned themselves over to the sinful ways of the world and are always wanting to do every kind of sinful act they can think of.",
      "20": "But you did not learn anything like this from Christ.",
      "21": "If you have heard of Him and have learned from Him,",
      "22": "put away the old person you used to be. Have nothing to do with your old sinful life. It was sinful because of being fooled into following bad desires.",
      "23": "Let your minds and hearts be made new.",
      "24": "You must become a new person and be God-like. Then you will be made right with God and have a true holy life.",
      "25": "So stop lying to each other. Tell the truth to your neighbor. We all belong to the same body.",
      "26": "If you are angry, do not let it become sin. Get over your anger before the day is finished.",
      "27": "Do not let the devil start working in your life.",
      "28": "Anyone who steals must stop it! He must work with his hands so he will have what he needs and can give to those who need help.",
      "29": "Watch your talk! No bad words should be coming from your mouth. Say what is good. Your words should help others grow as Christians.",
      "30": "Do not make God’s Holy Spirit have sorrow for the way you live. The Holy Spirit has put a mark on you for the day you will be set free.",
      "31": "Put out of your life all these things: bad feelings about other people, anger, temper, loud talk, bad talk which hurts other people, and bad feelings which hurt other people.",
      "32": "You must be kind to each other. Think of the other person. Forgive other people just as God forgave you because of Christ’s death on the cross."

      "3": "Do not let sex sins or anything sinful be even talked about among those who belong to Christ. Do not always want everything.",
      "4": "Do not be guilty of telling bad stories and of foolish talk. These things are not for you to do. Instead, you are to give thanks for what God has done for you.",
      "5": "Be sure of this! No person who does sex sins or who is not pure will have any part in the holy nation of Christ and of God. The same is true for the person who always wants what other people have. This becomes a god to him.",
      "6": "Do not let anyone lead you in the wrong way with foolish talk. The anger of God comes on such people because they choose to not obey Him.",
      "7": "Have nothing to do with them.",
      "8": "At one time you lived in darkness. Now you are living in the light that comes from the Lord. Live as children who have the light of the Lord in them.",
      "9": "This light gives us truth. It makes us right with God and makes us good.",
      "10": "Learn how to please the Lord.",
      "11": "Have nothing to do with the bad things done in darkness. Instead, show that these things are wrong.",
      "12": "It is a shame even to talk about these things done in secret.",
      "13": "All things can be seen when they are in the light. Everything that can be seen is in the light.",
      "14": "The Holy Writings say, “Wake up, you who are sleeping. Rise from the dead and Christ will give you light.”",
      "15": "So be careful how you live. Live as men who are wise and not foolish.",
      "16": "Make the best use of your time. These are sinful days.",
      "17": "Do not be foolish. Understand what the Lord wants you to do.",

      "22": "Wives, obey your own husbands. In doing this, you obey the Lord.",
      "23": "For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. It is His body (the church) that He saves.",
      "24": "As the church is to obey Christ, wives are to obey their own husbands in everything.",
      "25": "Husbands, love your wives. You must love them as Christ loved the church. He gave His life for it.",
      "26": "Christ did this so He could set the church apart for Himself. He made it clean by the washing of water with the Word.",
      "27": "Christ did this so the church might stand before Him in shining-greatness. There is to be no sin of any kind in it. It is to be holy and without blame.",
      "28": "So men should love their wives as they love their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.",
      "29": "No man hates himself. He takes care of his own body. That is the way Christ does. He cares for His body which is the church.",
      "30": "We are all a part of His body, the church.",
      "31": "For this reason, a man must leave his father and mother when he gets married and be joined to his wife. The two become one.",
      "32": "This is hard to understand, but it shows that the church is the body of Christ.",
      "33": "So every man must love his wife as he loves himself. Every wife must respect her husband."

      "4": "Fathers, do not be too hard on your children so they will become angry. Teach them in their growing years with Christian teaching.",
      "5": "You servants who are owned by someone must obey your owners. Work for them as hard as you can. Work for them the same as if you were working for Christ.",
      "6": "Do not work hard only when your owner sees you. You would be doing this just to please men. Work as you would work for Christ. Do what God wants you to do with all your heart.",
      "7": "Be happy as you work. Do your work as for the Lord, not for men.",
      "8": "Remember this, whatever good thing you do, the Lord will pay you for it. It is the same to the Lord if you are a servant owned by someone or if you work for pay.",
      "9": "Owners, do the right thing for those who work for you. Stop saying that you are going to be hard on them. Remember that your Owner and their Owner is in heaven. God does not respect one person more than another.",
      "10": "This is the last thing I want to say: Be strong with the Lord’s strength.",
      "11": "Put on the things God gives you to fight with. Then you will not fall into the traps of the devil.",
      "12": "Our fight is not with people. It is against the leaders and the powers and the spirits of darkness in this world. It is against the demon world that works in the heavens.",
      "13": "Because of this, put on all the things God gives you to fight with. Then you will be able to stand in that sinful day. When it is all over, you will still be standing.",
      "14": "So stand up and do not be moved. Wear a belt of truth around your body. Wear a piece of iron over your chest which is being right with God.",
      "15": "Wear shoes on your feet which are the Good News of peace.",
      "16": "Most important of all, you need a covering of faith in front of you. This is to put out the fire-arrows of the devil.",
      "17": "The covering for your head is that you have been saved from the punishment of sin. Take the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God.",
      "18": "You must pray at all times as the Holy Spirit leads you to pray. Pray for the things that are needed. You must watch and keep on praying. Remember to pray for all Christians.",
      "19": "Pray for me also. Pray that I might open my mouth without fear. Pray that I will use the right words to preach that which is hard to understand in the Good News.",
      "20": "This is the reason I was sent out. But now I am in chains for preaching the Good News. I want to keep on speaking for Christ without fear the way I should.",
