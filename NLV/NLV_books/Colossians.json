      "1": "This letter is from Paul, a missionary for Jesus Christ. God wanted me to work for Him. This letter is from brother Timothy also.",
      "2": "I am writing to you who belong to Christ in the city of Colossae. May all the Christian brothers there have loving-favor and peace from God our Father.",
      "3": "We always pray and give thanks to God for you. He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "We give thanks to God for you because we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus. We thank God for your love for all those who belong to Christ.",
      "5": "We thank God for the hope that is being kept for you in heaven. You first heard about this hope through the Good News which is the Word of Truth.",
      "6": "The Good News came to you the same as it is now going out to all the world. Lives are being changed, just as your life was changed the day you heard the Good News. You understood the truth about God’s loving-kindness.",
      "7": "You heard the Good News through our much-loved brother Epaphras who is taking my place. He is a faithful servant of Christ.",
      "8": "He told us that the Holy Spirit had given you much love.",
      "9": "This is why I have never stopped praying for you since I heard about you. I ask God that you may know what He wants you to do. I ask God to fill you with the wisdom and understanding the Holy Spirit gives.",
      "10": "Then your lives will please the Lord. You will do every kind of good work, and you will know more about God.",
      "11": "I pray that God’s great power will make you strong, and that you will have joy as you wait and do not give up.",
      "12": "I pray that you will be giving thanks to the Father. He has made it so you could share the good things given to those who belong to Christ who are in the light.",
      "13": "God took us out of a life of darkness. He has put us in the holy nation of His much-loved Son.",
      "14": "We have been bought by His blood and made free. Our sins are forgiven through Him.",
      "15": "Christ is as God is. God cannot be seen. Christ lived before anything was made.",
      "16": "Christ made everything in the heavens and on the earth. He made everything that is seen and things that are not seen. He made all the powers of heaven. Everything was made by Him and for Him.",
      "17": "Christ was before all things. All things are held together by Him.",
      "18": "Christ is the head of the church which is His body. He is the beginning of all things. He is the first to be raised from the dead. He is to have first place in everything.",
      "19": "God the Father was pleased to have everything made perfect by Christ, His Son.",
      "20": "Everything in heaven and on earth can come to God because of Christ’s death on the cross. Christ’s blood has made peace.",
      "21": "At one time you were strangers to God and your minds were at war with Him. Your thoughts and actions were wrong.",
      "22": "But Christ has brought you back to God by His death on the cross. In this way, Christ can bring you to God, holy and pure and without blame.",
      "23": "This is for you if you keep the faith. You must not change from what you believe now. You must not leave the hope of the Good News you received. The Good News was preached to you and to all the world. And I, Paul, am one of Christ’s missionaries.",
      "24": "Now I am full of joy to be suffering for you. In my own body I am doing my share of what has to be done to make Christ’s sufferings complete. This is for His body which is the Church.",
      "25": "I became a preacher in His church for your good. In the plan of God I am to preach the Good News.",
      "26": "This great secret was hidden to the people of times past, but it is now made known to those who belong to Christ.",
      "27": "God wants these great riches of the hidden truth to be made known to the people who are not Jews. The secret is this: Christ in you brings hope of all the great things to come.",
      "28": "We preach Christ. We tell every man how he must live. We use wisdom in teaching every man. We do this so every man will be complete in Christ.",
      "29": "This is the reason I am working. God’s great power is working in me."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "I want you to know how hard I have worked for you and for the Christians in the city of Laodicea and for those who have never seen me.",
      "2": "May their hearts be given comfort. May they be brought close together in Christian love. May they be rich in understanding and know God’s secret. It is Christ Himself.",
      "3": "In Christ are hidden all the riches of wisdom and understanding.",
      "4": "I tell you this so no one will try to change your mind with big sounding talk.",
      "5": "Even if I am far away from you in body, I am with you in spirit. I am happy to learn how well you are getting along. It is good to hear that your faith is so strong in Christ.",
      "6": "As you have put your trust in Christ Jesus the Lord to save you from the punishment of sin, now let Him lead you in every step.",
      "7": "Have your roots planted deep in Christ. Grow in Him. Get your strength from Him. Let Him make you strong in the faith as you have been taught. Your life should be full of thanks to Him.",
      "8": "Be careful that no one changes your mind and faith by much learning and big sounding ideas. Those things are what men dream up. They are always trying to make new religions. These leave out Christ.",
      "9": "For Christ is not only God-like, He is God in human flesh.",
      "10": "When you have Christ, you are complete. He is the head over all leaders and powers.",
      "11": "When you became a Christian, you were set free from the sinful things of the world. This was not done by human hands. You were set free from the sins of your old self by what was done in Christ’s body.",
      "12": "When you were baptized, you were buried as Christ was buried. When you were raised up in baptism, you were raised as Christ was raised. You were raised to a new life by putting your trust in God. It was God Who raised Jesus from the dead.",
      "13": "When you were dead in your sins, you were not set free from the sinful things of the world. But God forgave your sins and gave you new life through Christ.",
      "14": "We had broken the Law many ways. Those sins were held against us by the Law. That Law had writings which said we were sinners. But now He has destroyed that writing by nailing it to the cross.",
      "15": "God took away the power of the leaders of this world and the powers of darkness. He showed them to the world. The battle was won over them through Christ.",
      "16": "Do not let anyone tell you what you should or should not eat or drink. They have no right to say if it is right or wrong to eat certain foods or if you are to go to religious suppers. They have no right to say what you are to do at the time of the new moon or on the Day of Rest.",
      "17": "These things are a picture of what is coming. The important thing is Christ Himself.",
      "18": "Do not let anyone rob you of your crown. They will try to get you to bow down in worship of angels. They think this shows you are not proud. They say they were told to do this in a dream. These people are proud because of their sinful minds.",
      "19": "Such people are not a part of Christ. Christ is the Head. We Christians make up His body. We are joined together as a body is held together. Our strength to grow comes from Christ.",
      "20": "You have died with Christ and become dead to those old ways. Then why do you follow the old ways of worship? Why do you obey man-made rules?",
      "21": "These rules say, “You must not put your hand on this.” “Do not put this into your mouth.” “You must not put your finger on that.”",
      "22": "All these things come to an end when they are used. You are following only man-made rules.",
      "23": "It looks as if it is wise to follow these rules in an act of worship, because they are hard on the body. It looks as if they are done without pride, but they are worth nothing. They do not take away a man’s desire to sin."

    "3": {
      "1": "If then you have been raised with Christ, keep looking for the good things of heaven. This is where Christ is seated on the right side of God.",
      "2": "Keep your minds thinking about things in heaven. Do not think about things on the earth.",
      "3": "You are dead to the things of this world. Your new life is now hidden in God through Christ.",
      "4": "Christ is our life. When He comes again, you will also be with Him to share His shining-greatness.",
      "5": "Destroy the desires to sin that are in you. These desires are: sex sins, anything that is not clean, a desire for sex sins, and wanting something someone else has. This is worshiping a god.",
      "6": "It is because of these sins that the anger of God comes down on those who do not obey Him.",
      "7": "You used to do these sins when you lived that kind of life.",
      "8": "Put out of your life these things also: anger, bad temper, bad feelings toward others, talk that hurts people, speaking against God, and dirty talk.",
      "9": "Do not lie to each other. You have put out of your life your old ways.",
      "10": "You have now become a new person and are always learning more about Christ. You are being made more like Christ. He is the One Who made you.",
      "11": "There is no difference in men in this new life. Greeks and Jews are the same. The man who has gone through the religious act of becoming a Jew and the one who has not are the same. There is no difference between nations. Men who are servants and those who are free are the same. Christ is everything. He is in all of us.",
      "12": "God has chosen you. You are holy and loved by Him. Because of this, your new life should be full of loving-pity. You should be kind to others and have no pride. Be gentle and be willing to wait for others.",
      "13": "Try to understand other people. Forgive each other. If you have something against someone, forgive him. That is the way the Lord forgave you.",
      "14": "And to all these things, you must add love. Love holds everything and everybody together and makes all these good things perfect.",
      "15": "Let the peace of Christ have power over your hearts. You were chosen as a part of His body. Always be thankful.",
      "16": "Let the teaching of Christ and His words keep on living in you. These make your lives rich and full of wisdom. Keep on teaching and helping each other. Sing the Songs of David and the church songs and the songs of heaven with hearts full of thanks to God.",
      "17": "Whatever you say or do, do it in the name of the Lord Jesus. Give thanks to God the Father through the Lord Jesus.",
      "18": "Wives, obey your husbands. This is what the Lord wants you to do.",
      "19": "Husbands, love your wives. Do not hold hard feelings against them.",
      "20": "Children, obey your parents in everything. The Lord is pleased when you do.",
      "21": "Fathers, do not be so hard on your children that they will give up trying to do what is right.",
      "22": "You who are servants who are owned by someone, obey your owners. Work hard for them all the time, not just when they are watching you. Work for them as you would for the Lord because you honor God.",
      "23": "Whatever work you do, do it with all your heart. Do it for the Lord and not for men.",
      "24": "Remember that you will get your reward from the Lord. He will give you what you should receive. You are working for the Lord Christ.",
      "25": "If anyone does wrong, he will suffer for it. God does not respect one person more than another."

    "4": {
      "1": "Owners, give your servants what is right. Do the same for all. Remember that your Owner is in heaven.",
      "2": "You must keep praying. Keep watching! Be thankful always.",
      "3": "As you pray, be sure to pray for us also. Pray that God will open the door for us to preach the Word. We want to tell the secret of Christ. And this is the reason I am in prison.",
      "4": "Pray that I will be able to preach so everyone can understand. This is the way I should speak.",
      "5": "Be wise in the way you live around those who are not Christians. Make good use of your time.",
      "6": "Speak with them in such a way they will want to listen to you. Do not let your talk sound foolish. Know how to give the right answer to anyone.",
      "7": "Tychicus will tell you how I am getting along. He is a much-loved brother and faithful helper. Both of us are owned by the Lord.",
      "8": "This is the reason I have sent him to you. It is so you can know about us. He can also bring joy to your hearts.",
      "9": "Onesimus is going with Tychicus. He is one of your own people. He is faithful and we love him very much. They will tell you about everything here.",
      "10": "One of the men here in prison with me is Aristarchus. He says hello you. Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, says hello. (You have heard before that if he comes to you, you are to receive him and make him happy.)",
      "11": "Jesus Justus says hello also. These are the only Jewish workers helping me teach about the holy nation of God. What a help they have been to me!",
      "12": "Epaphras says hello. He is one of your people and a servant of Jesus Christ. As he prays for you, he asks God to help you to be strong and to make you perfect. He prays that you will know what God wants you to do in all things.",
      "13": "I can tell you for sure that he works hard for you and for the Christians in the cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis.",
      "14": "Luke, the dear doctor, and Demas say hello.",
      "15": "Greet all the Christians in Laodicea. Greet Nympha and the Christians who gather for church in her house.",
      "16": "When this letter has been read to you, have it read in the church in Laodicea also. Be sure you read the letter that is coming from Laodicea.",
      "17": "Tell Archippus to be sure to finish the work the Lord called him to do.",
      "18": "I, Paul, am writing this last part with my own hand. Do not forget that I am in prison. May you have God’s loving-favor."
