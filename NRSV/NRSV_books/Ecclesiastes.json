      "4": "A generation goes, and a generation comes,\n    but the earth remains forever.",
      "5": "The sun rises, and the sun goes down\n    and hurries to the place where it rises.",
      "6": "The wind blows to the south\n    and goes around to the north;\nround and round goes the wind,\n    and on its circuits the wind returns.",
      "7": "All streams run to the sea,\n    but the sea is not full;\nto the place where the streams flow,\n    there they continue to flow.",
      "8": "All things are wearisome,\n    more than one can express;\nthe eye is not satisfied with seeing\n    or the ear filled with hearing.",
      "9": "What has been is what will be,\n    and what has been done is what will be done;\n    there is nothing new under the sun.",
      "10": "Is there a thing of which it is said,\n    “See, this is new”?\nIt has already been\n    in the ages before us.",
      "11": "The people of long ago are not remembered,\n    nor will there be any remembrance\nof people yet to come\n    by those who come after them.",
      "12": "I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
      "13": "I applied my mind to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven; it is an unhappy business that God has given to humans to be busy with.",
      "14": "I saw all the deeds that are done under the sun, and see, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.",
      "15": "What is crooked cannot be made straight,\n    and what is lacking cannot be counted.",
      "16": "I said to myself, “I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my mind has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”",
      "17": "And I applied my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a chasing after wind.",

    "2": {
      "1": "I said to myself, “Come now, I will make a test of pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But again, this also was vanity.",
      "2": "I said of laughter, “It is mad,” and of pleasure, “What use is it?”",
      "3": "I searched with my mind how to cheer my body with wine—my mind still guiding me with wisdom—and how to lay hold on folly, until I might see what was good for mortals to do under heaven during the few days of their life.",
      "4": "I made great works; I built houses and planted vineyards for myself;",

      "7": "I bought male and female slaves and had slaves who were born in my house; I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.",
      "8": "I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I got singers, both men and women, and delights of the flesh, many concubines.",
      "9": "So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.",
      "10": "Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure from all my toil, and this was my reward from all my toil.",
      "11": "Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had spent in doing it, and again, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.",
      "12": "So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly, for what can the king’s successor do? Only what has already been done.",
      "13": "Then I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.",
      "14": "The wise have eyes in their head,\n    but fools walk in darkness.\nYet I perceived that the same fate befalls all of them.",
      "15": "Then I said to myself, “What happens to the fool will happen to me also; why then have I been so very wise?” And I said to myself that this also is vanity.",
      "16": "For there is no enduring remembrance of the wise or of fools, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How can the wise die just like fools?",
      "17": "So I hated life because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.",
      "18": "I hated all my toil in which I had toiled under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to my successor,",
      "19": "and who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.",
      "20": "So I turned and gave my heart up to despair concerning all the toil of my labors under the sun,",
      "21": "because sometimes one who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave all to be enjoyed by another who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.",
      "22": "What do mortals get from all the toil and strain with which they toil under the sun?",
      "23": "For all their days are full of pain, and their work is a vexation; even at night their minds do not rest. This also is vanity.",
      "24": "There is nothing better for mortals than to eat and drink and find enjoyment in their toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God,",
      "25": "for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment?",
      "26": "For to the one who pleases him God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he gives the work of gathering and heaping, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind."

      "15": "That which is already has been, that which is to be already is, and God seeks out what has gone by.",
      "16": "Moreover, I saw under the sun that, in the place of justice, wickedness was there, and in the place of righteousness, wickedness was there as well.",
      "17": "I said to myself, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for he has appointed a time for every matter and for every work.”",
      "18": "I said to myself with regard to humans that God is testing them to show that they are but animals.",

      "21": "Who knows whether the human spirit goes upward and the spirit of animals goes downward to the earth?",

      "4": "Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from one person’s envy of another. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.",

      "9": "Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their toil.",
      "10": "For if they fall, one will lift up the other, but woe to one who is alone and falls and does not have another to help.",
      "11": "Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?",
      "12": "And though one might prevail against another, two will withstand one. A threefold cord is not quickly broken.",
      "13": "Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who will no longer take advice.",
      "14": "One can indeed come out of prison to reign, even though born poor in the kingdom.",

      "12": "Sweet is the sleep of laborers, whether they eat little or much, but the abundance of the rich will not let them sleep.",
      "13": "There is a grievous ill that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owners to their hurt,",
      "14": "and those riches were lost in a bad venture; though they are parents of children, they have nothing in their hands.",
      "15": "As they came from their mother’s womb, so they shall go again, naked as they came; they shall take nothing for their toil that they may carry away with their hands.",
