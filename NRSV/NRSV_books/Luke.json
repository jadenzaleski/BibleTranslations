      "26": "As they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.",
      "27": "A great number of the people followed him, and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.",
      "28": "But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.",
      "29": "For the days are surely coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’",

      "40": "But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?",
      "41": "And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”",
      "42": "Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.”",

      "48": "And when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they returned home, beating their breasts.",
      "49": "But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching these things.",
      "50": "Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph who, though a member of the council,",
      "51": "had not agreed to their plan and action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God.",
      "52": "This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.",
