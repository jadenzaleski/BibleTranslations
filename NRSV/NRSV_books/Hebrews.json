      "2": "but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds.",
      "3": "He is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact imprint of God’s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,",
      "4": "having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.",
      "5": "For to which of the angels did God ever say,\n“You are my Son;\n    today I have begotten you”?\nOr again,\n“I will be his Father,\n    and he will be my Son”?",
      "6": "And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,\n“Let all God’s angels worship him.”",
      "7": "Of the angels he says,\n“He makes his angels winds\n    and his servants flames of fire.”",
      "8": "But of the Son he says,\n“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,\n    and the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.",
      "9": "You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;\ntherefore God, your God, has anointed you\n    with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.”",

      "12": "like a cloak you will roll them up,\n    and like clothing they will be changed.\nBut you are the same,\n    and your years will never end.”",
      "13": "And to which of the angels has he ever said,\n“Sit at my right hand\n    until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?",

      "4": "while God added his testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, distributed according to his will.",
      "5": "Now God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels.",
      "6": "But someone has testified somewhere,\n“What are humans that you are mindful of them\n    or mortals that you care for them?",
      "7": "You have made them for a little while lower than the angels;\n    you have crowned them with glory and honor,",
      "8": "subjecting all things under their feet.”\nNow in subjecting all things to them, God left nothing outside their control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to them,",
      "9": "but we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.",
      "10": "It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.",
      "11": "For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,",
      "12": "saying,\n“I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters;\n    in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.”",
      "13": "And again,\n“I will put my trust in him.”\nAnd again,\n“Here am I and the children whom God has given me.”",

      "16": "For it is clear that he did not come to help angels but the descendants of Abraham.",
      "17": "Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people.",

      "4": "(For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)",

      "7": "Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,",
      "8": "do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,\n    as on the day of testing in the wilderness,",
      "9": "where your ancestors put me to the test,\nthough they had seen my works",
      "10": "for forty years.\nTherefore I was angry with that generation,\nand I said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts,\n    and they have not known my ways.’",

      "12": "Take care, brothers and sisters, that none of you may have an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.",
      "13": "But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.",

      "15": "As it is said,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\ndo not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”",
      "16": "Now who were they who heard and rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?",
      "17": "And with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?",
      "18": "And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who were disobedient?",
      "19": "So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief."

      "1": "Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest is still open, let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it.",
      "2": "For indeed the good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them because they were not united by faith with those who listened.",
      "3": "For we who have believed are entering that rest, just as God has said,\n“As in my anger I swore,\n‘They shall not enter my rest,’ ”\nthough his works were finished since the foundation of the world.",
      "4": "For somewhere it speaks about the seventh day as follows, “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.”",
      "5": "And again in this place it says, “They shall not enter my rest.”",
      "6": "Since therefore it remains open for some to enter it and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,",
      "7": "again he sets a certain day—“today”—saying through David much later, in the words already quoted,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\ndo not harden your hearts.”",
      "8": "For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak later about another day.",
      "9": "So then, a Sabbath rest still remains for the people of God,",
      "10": "for those who enter God’s rest also rest from their labors as God did from his.",
      "11": "Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall through such disobedience as theirs.",
      "12": "Indeed, the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.",
      "13": "And before him no creature is hidden, but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account.",
      "14": "Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.",
      "15": "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin.",

      "3": "and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people.",
      "4": "And one does not presume to take this honor but takes it only when called by God, just as Aaron was.",
      "5": "So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest but was appointed by the one who said to him,\n“You are my Son;\n    today I have begotten you”;",
      "6": "as he says also in another place,\n“You are a priest forever,\n    according to the order of Melchizedek.”",
      "7": "In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.",
      "8": "Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered,",
      "9": "and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,",
      "10": "having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.",
      "11": "About this we have much to say that is hard to explain, since you have become sluggish in hearing.",
      "12": "For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food,",
      "13": "for everyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is unskilled in the word of righteousness.",
      "14": "But solid food is for the mature, for those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish good from evil."

      "3": "And we will do this, if God permits.",
      "4": "For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have shared in the Holy Spirit",
      "5": "and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come",
      "6": "and then have fallen away, since they are crucifying again the Son of God to their own harm and are holding him up to contempt.",
      "7": "Ground that drinks up the rain falling on it repeatedly and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives a blessing from God.",
      "8": "But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and on the verge of being cursed; its end is to be burned over.",
      "9": "Even though we speak in this way, beloved, we are confident of better things in your case, things that belong to salvation.",
      "10": "For God is not unjust; he will not overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.",
      "11": "And we want each one of you to show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope to the very end,",
      "12": "so that you may not become sluggish but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.",
      "13": "When God made a promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,",
      "14": "saying, “I will surely bless you and multiply you.”",
      "15": "And thus Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise.",
      "16": "Humans, of course, swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute among them.",
      "17": "In the same way, when God desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it by an oath,",
      "18": "so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible that God would prove false, we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us.",
      "19": "We have this hope, a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain,",

      "7": "It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.",
      "8": "In the one case, tithes are received by those who are mortal; in the other, by one of whom it is testified that he lives.",
      "9": "One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,",

      "12": "For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.",
      "13": "Now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.",
      "14": "For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.",
      "15": "It is even more obvious when another priest arises, resembling Melchizedek,",
      "16": "one who has become a priest, not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent but through the power of an indestructible life.",
      "17": "For it is attested of him,\n“You are a priest forever,\n    according to the order of Melchizedek.”",
      "18": "There is, on the one hand, the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual",

      "27": "Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself.",

      "3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.",
      "4": "Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are already those who offer gifts according to the law.",
      "5": "They offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one, just as Moses was warned when he was about to erect the tent. For, God said, “See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”",
      "6": "But Jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on the basis of better promises.",
      "7": "For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one.",

      "9": "This is a symbol of the present time, indicating that gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper",
      "10": "but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms, regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right.",
      "11": "But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation),",

      "13": "For if the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified,",
      "14": "how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!",
      "15": "For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.",
      "16": "Where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.",
      "17": "For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.",
      "18": "Hence not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood.",
      "19": "For when every commandment had been told to all the people by Moses in accordance with the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,",

      "21": "And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship.",
      "22": "Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.",
      "23": "Thus it was necessary for the sketches of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves need better sacrifices than these.",
      "24": "For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands, a mere copy of the true one, but he entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.",
      "25": "Nor was it to offer himself again and again, as the high priest enters the holy place year after year with blood that is not his own,",

      "13": "and since then has been waiting “until his enemies would be made a footstool for his feet.”",
      "14": "For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.",
      "15": "And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,",
      "16": "“This is the covenant that I will make with them\n    after those days, says the Lord:\nI will put my laws in their hearts,\n    and I will write them on their minds,”",

      "25": "not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.",
      "26": "For if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins",
      "27": "but a fearful prospect of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.",
      "28": "Anyone who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy “on the testimony of two or three witnesses.”",
      "29": "How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace?",
