    "1": {
      "1": "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.",
      "2": "As it is written in the Prophets:\n“Look, I am sending My messenger before Your face,\n    who will prepare Your way before You.”",
      "3": "“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:\n‘Prepare the way of the Lord,\n    make His paths straight.’ ”",
      "4": "John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.",
      "5": "The whole region of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.",
      "6": "John was clothed with camel’s hair and with a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.",
      "7": "He preached saying, “After me is coming One mightier than I, the straps of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.",
      "8": "I indeed have baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”",
      "9": "In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.",
      "10": "Coming up out of the water, He immediately saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove.",
      "11": "And a voice came from heaven, saying, “You are My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.”",
      "12": "The Spirit immediately drove Him into the wilderness.",
      "13": "And He was there in the wilderness for forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts. And the angels ministered to Him.",
      "14": "After John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,",
      "15": "saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the gospel.”",
      "16": "As He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, his brother, throwing a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.",
      "17": "Jesus said to them, “Come, follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”",
      "18": "Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.",
      "19": "When He had gone a little farther from there, He saw James the son of Zebedee and John, his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.",
      "20": "Immediately He called them. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed Him.",
      "21": "They went to Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and taught.",
      "22": "They were astonished at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.",
      "23": "In their synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit.",
      "24": "And he cried out, “Leave us alone! What do You have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are, the Holy One of God.”",
      "25": "Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!”",
      "26": "When the unclean spirit had convulsed him and cried out with a loud voice, it came out of him.",
      "27": "They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, “What is this? What new teaching is this? With authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.”",
      "28": "Immediately His fame spread everywhere throughout the region surrounding Galilee.",
      "29": "When He came out of the synagogue with James and John, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew.",
      "30": "The mother of Simon’s wife lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told Him of her.",
      "31": "So He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them.",
      "32": "In the evening, when the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were possessed with demons.",
      "33": "The whole city was gathered at the door,",
      "34": "and He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. And He did not let the demons speak, because they knew Him.",
      "35": "In the morning, rising up a great while before sunrise, He went out and departed to a solitary place. And there He prayed.",
      "36": "Simon and those who were with Him followed Him,",
      "37": "and when they found Him, they said to Him, “Everyone is searching for You.”",
      "38": "He said to them, “Let us go into the nearby towns, that I may preach there also. For that is why I have come.”",
      "39": "So He preached in their synagogues throughout Galilee and cast out demons.",
      "40": "A leper came to Him, pleading with Him and kneeling before Him, saying, “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”",
      "41": "Then Jesus, moved with compassion, extended His hand and touched him, and said to him, “I will. Be clean.”",
      "42": "As soon as He had spoken, the leprosy immediately departed from him, and he was cleansed.",
      "43": "He sternly warned him, and sent him away at once,",
      "44": "saying, “See that you say nothing to anyone. But go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”",
      "45": "Instead he went out and began to proclaim it widely and to spread the news around, so that Jesus could no more openly enter the city, but was out in remote places. And they came to Him from every quarter."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Again, He entered Capernaum after some days. And it was reported that He was in the house.",
      "2": "Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no room to receive them, not even at the door. And He preached the word to them.",
      "3": "They came to Him bringing one sick with paralysis, who was carried by four men.",
      "4": "When they could not come near Him due to the crowding, they uncovered the roof where He was. When they had broken it open, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.",
      "5": "When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.”",
      "6": "But some of the scribes were sitting there, reasoning in their hearts,",
      "7": "“Why does this Man speak such blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”",
      "8": "Immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, He said to them, “Why do you contemplate these things in your hearts?",
      "9": "Which is easier to say to the paralytic: ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your bed and walk’?",
      "10": "But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” He said to the paralytic,",
      "11": "“I say to you, rise, and take up your bed, and go your way to your house.”",
      "12": "Immediately he rose, picked up the bed, and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”",
      "13": "He went out again by the seaside, and the whole crowd came to Him, and He taught them.",
      "14": "As He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s station, and He said to him, “Follow Me.” And he rose and followed Him.",
      "15": "As Jesus was at supper in his house, many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and His disciples. For there were many, and they followed Him.",
      "16": "When the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, “How is it that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”",
      "17": "When Jesus heard it, He said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”",
      "18": "Now the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to Him, “Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?”",
      "19": "Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.",
      "20": "But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.",
      "21": "“No one sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment, or else the new piece that covered it tears away from the old, and the tear is made worse.",
      "22": "And no one pours new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins will be marred. But new wine must be poured into new wineskins.”",
      "23": "He went through the grain fields on the Sabbath. As they went, His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain.",
      "24": "The Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why are they doing on the Sabbath what is not lawful?”",
      "25": "He said to them, “Have you never read what David did, when he and those who were with him were in need and hungry:",
      "26": "how he went into the house of God, in the days Abiathar was the high priest, and ate the ritual bread, which is lawful only for the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?”",
      "27": "Then He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.",
      "28": "So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Again, He entered the synagogue, and there was a man who had a withered hand.",
      "2": "They watched Him to see whether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.",
      "3": "He said to the man who had the withered hand, “Stand up.”",
      "4": "Then He said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath, to save life or to kill?” But they kept silent.",
      "5": "When He had looked around at them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, “Stretch your hand forward.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.",
      "6": "Then the Pharisees went out and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how to kill Him.",
      "7": "Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great crowd followed Him from Galilee and Judea",
      "8": "and Jerusalem, and Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan. And those from Tyre and Sidon, a great crowd, when they heard what great things He did, came to Him.",
      "9": "He told the disciples to have a small boat ready for Him because of the crowd, lest they should crush Him.",
      "10": "For He had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed on Him to touch Him.",
      "11": "When unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him, crying out, “You are the Son of God.”",
      "12": "But He sternly ordered them not to make Him known.",
      "13": "He went up into the mountain and called to Him those whom He desired, and they came to Him.",
      "14": "He ordained twelve to be with Him, and to be sent out to preach,",
      "15": "and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:",
      "16": "Simon, whom He named Peter;",
      "17": "James, the son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James, whom he surnamed Boanerges (meaning Sons of Thunder);",
      "18": "Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas; and James the son of Alphaeus; and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;",
      "19": "and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.",
      "20": "Then they entered a house, and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat bread.",
      "21": "When His family heard of it, they went out to seize Him, for they said, “He is beside Himself.”",
      "22": "And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebub, and by the ruler of the demons He casts out demons.”",
      "23": "So He called them to Him and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?",
      "24": "If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.",
      "25": "If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.",
      "26": "And if Satan rises up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.",
      "27": "No one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then he will plunder his house.",
      "28": "Truly I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they speak.",
      "29": "But he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal condemnation.”",
      "30": "For they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”",
      "31": "Then His mother and His brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to Him, calling Him.",
      "32": "The crowd sat around Him and said to Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are outside asking for You.”",
      "33": "He answered, “Who are My mother and My brothers?”",
      "34": "Then He looked around at those who sat around Him and said, “Here are My mother and My brothers!",
      "35": "For whoever does the will of God is My brother, and My sister, and My mother.”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Again He began to teach by the seaside. A large crowd was gathered before Him, so that He entered a boat and sat in it on the sea. And the whole crowd was by the sea on the land.",
      "2": "He taught them many things in parables and said to them in His teaching:",
      "3": "“Listen! And take note: A sower went out to sow.",
      "4": "As he sowed, some seed fell beside the path, and the birds of the air came and devoured it.",
      "5": "Some seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and soon it sprang up because it did not have deep soil.",
      "6": "But when the sun rose, it was scorched. And because it had no root, it withered away.",
      "7": "Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.",
      "8": "And other seed fell on good ground, and it yielded grain that sprang up and increased by thirty, sixty, or a hundred times as much.”",
      "9": "Then He said to them, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
      "10": "When He was alone, those who were around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable.",
      "11": "He said to them, “To you is given the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, everything is said in parables,",
      "12": "so that\n‘seeing they may see, and not perceive,\n    and hearing they may hear and not understand;\nlest they should turn, and their sins be forgiven them.’”",
      "13": "Then He said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?",
      "14": "The sower sows the word.",
      "15": "These are those beside the path, where the word is sown. But when they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word which is sown in their hearts.",
      "16": "Others, likewise, are seed sown on rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with gladness,",
      "17": "but have no root in themselves, and so endure for a time. Afterward, when affliction or persecution rises for the word’s sake, immediately they fall away.",
      "18": "And others are seed sown among thorns, the ones who hear the word.",
      "19": "But the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things entering in choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.",
      "20": "Still others are seed sown on good ground, those who hear the word, and receive it, and bear fruit: thirty, sixty, or a hundred times as much.”",
      "21": "He said to them, “Is a candle brought to be put under a basket or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick?",
      "22": "For there is nothing hidden except to be revealed; neither is anything kept secret except to be proclaimed.",
      "23": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
      "24": "He said to them, “Take heed what you hear. The measure you give will be measured for you, and to you who hear will more be given.",
      "25": "For to him who has will more be given. And from him who has not will be taken, even what he has.”",
      "26": "He said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground.",
      "27": "He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; he does not know how.",
      "28": "For the earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then the head, then the full seed in the head.",
      "29": "But when the grain is ripe, immediately he applies the sickle because the harvest has come.”",
      "30": "He said, “To what shall we liken the kingdom of God, or with what parable shall we compare it?",
      "31": "It is like a grain of mustard seed which, when it is sown in the ground, is the smallest seed on earth.",
      "32": "Yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all shrubs, and shoots out great branches, so that the birds of the air may nest in its shade.”",
      "33": "With many such parables He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it.",
      "34": "Without a parable He did not speak to them. But when they were alone, He expounded on all things to His disciples.",
      "35": "That same day, when the evening came, He said to them, “Let us go cross to the other side.”",
      "36": "When they had sent the crowd away, they took Him in the boat just as He was. There were also other little boats with Him.",
      "37": "A great wind storm arose, and the waves splashed into the boat, so that it was now filling the boat.",
      "38": "He was in the stern asleep on a pillow. They woke Him and said, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?”",
      "39": "He rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace, be still!” Then the wind ceased and there was a great calm.",
      "40": "He said to them, “Why are you so fearful? How is that you have no faith?”",
      "41": "They feared greatly and said to one another, “What kind of Man is He, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "They went to the other side of the sea to the region of the Gadarenes.",
      "2": "When He had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met Him.",
      "3": "He lived among the tombs. And no one could constrain him, not even with chains,",
      "4": "because he had often been bound with shackles and chains. But he had pulled the chains apart and broken the shackles to pieces. And no one could subdue him.",
      "5": "Always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.",
      "6": "But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran up and kneeled before Him,",
      "7": "and cried out with a loud voice, “What have You to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me.”",
      "8": "For Jesus said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”",
      "9": "Then He asked him, “What is your name?”\nHe answered, “My name is Legion. For we are many.”",
      "10": "And he begged Him repeatedly not to send them away out of the country.",
      "11": "Now there was a great herd of swine feeding near the mountains.",
      "12": "All the demons pleaded with Him, asking, “Send us to the swine, so that we may enter them.”",
      "13": "At once, Jesus gave them leave. Then the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine. And the herd, numbering about two thousand, ran wildly down a steep hill into the sea and were drowned in the sea.",
      "14": "Those who fed the swine fled and reported it in the city and in the country. And people went out to see what it was that had happened.",
      "15": "They came to Jesus and saw him who had been possessed with the legion of demons sitting and clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.",
      "16": "Those who saw it told them how it befell him who had been possessed with the demons and also concerning the swine.",
      "17": "Then they began to plead with Him to depart out of their region.",
      "18": "When He entered the boat, he who had been possessed with the demons prayed Him that he might be with Him.",
      "19": "Jesus did not let him, but said to him, “Go home to your friends and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how He has had compassion on you.”",
      "20": "So he departed and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed.",
      "21": "When Jesus had crossed again by boat to the other side, many people gathered to Him. And He was beside the sea.",
      "22": "One of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus, saw Jesus and came and fell at His feet",
      "23": "and earnestly asked Him, “My little daughter is lying at the point of death. I ask You, come and lay Your hands on her, so that she may be healed. And she will live.”",
      "24": "So Jesus went with him.\nAnd many people followed Him and pressed in on Him.",
      "25": "And a certain woman had a hemorrhage for twelve years,",
      "26": "and had suffered much under many physicians. She had spent all that she had, and was not better but rather grew worse.",
      "27": "When she had heard of Jesus, she came in the crowd behind Him and touched His garment.",
      "28": "For she said, “If I may touch His garments, I shall be healed.”",
      "29": "And immediately her hemorrhage dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction.",
      "30": "At once, Jesus knew within Himself that power had gone out of Him. He turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched My garments?”",
      "31": "His disciples said to Him, “You see the crowd pressing against You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’ ”",
      "32": "And He looked around to see her who had done it.",
      "33": "But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the entire truth.",
      "34": "He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.”",
      "35": "While He was still speaking, some came from the house of the synagogue ruler and said, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”",
      "36": "As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not be afraid, only believe.”",
      "37": "He let no one follow Him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.",
      "38": "He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw the tumult, and those who wept and wailed loudly.",
      "39": "When He came in, He said to them, “Why make this uproar and weep? The girl is not dead, but sleeping.”",
      "40": "They laughed at Him in ridicule.\nBut when He had put them all out, He took the father and the mother of the girl and those who were with Him and entered where the girl was lying.",
      "41": "He took the girl by the hand and said to her, “Talitha cumi,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, arise.”",
      "42": "Immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years of age. And they were greatly astonished.",
      "43": "He strictly ordered them to let no one know of it and directed them to give her something to eat."

    "6": {
      "1": "He went away from there and came into His own country. And His disciples followed Him.",
      "2": "When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing Him were astonished, saying, “Where did this Man get this? What is this wisdom that is given Him, that even miracles are done by His hands?",
      "3": "Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary and the brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon? Are not His sisters here with us?” And they took offense at Him.",
      "4": "Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.”",
      "5": "He could not do any miracles there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.",
      "6": "And He was amazed because of their unbelief.\nThen He went to the surrounding villages, teaching.",
      "7": "He called to Him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over unclean spirits.",
      "8": "He commanded them to take nothing for their journey except a staff: no bag, no bread, and no money in their purse,",
      "9": "but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.",
      "10": "He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, remain there until you depart from that place.",
      "11": "And whoever will not receive you or hear you, when you depart from there, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them. Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment than for that city.”",
      "12": "So they went out and preached that men should repent.",
      "13": "And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.",
      "14": "King Herod heard of Him, for His name was spread publicly. He said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and therefore these miracles are at work in him.”",
      "15": "But others said, “He is Elijah.”\nAnd yet others said, “He is the Prophet, or like one of the prophets.”",
      "16": "But when Herod heard of it, he said, “It is John, whom I beheaded. He has been raised from the dead!”",
      "17": "Herod had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her.",
      "18": "For John said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”",
      "19": "So Herodias had a grudge against him and would have killed him, but she could not,",
      "20": "for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and protected him. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, but heard him gladly.",
      "21": "But a convenient day came when Herod on his birthday prepared a ceremonial dinner for his lords and commanding officers and leading men of Galilee.",
      "22": "When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, “Ask of me whatever you desire, and I will give it to you.”",
