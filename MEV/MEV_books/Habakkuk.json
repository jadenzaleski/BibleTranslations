      "1": "The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.",
      "2": "O Lord, how long shall I cry,\n    and You will not hear?\nOr cry to You, “Violence!”\n    and You will not save?",
      "3": "Why do You make me see wickedness,\n    and cause me to see trouble?\nPlundering and violence are before me;\n    strife and contention arise.",
      "4": "Therefore the law is powerless,\n    and justice never goes forth.\nFor the wicked surround the righteous;\n    therefore injustice proceeds.",
      "5": "Look among the nations, and watch—\n    wonder and be amazed!\nFor I am doing a work in your days\n    that you would not believe,\n    though it were told you.",
      "6": "For I am raising up the Chaldeans,\n    that bitter and hasty nation\nwhich marches through the breadth of the earth,\n    to possess dwelling places that are not theirs.",
      "7": "They are terrible and dreadful;\n    their justice and their dignity\n    proceed from themselves.",
      "8": "Their horses are swifter than leopards,\n    more fierce than evening wolves.\nTheir horsemen charge on;\n    their horsemen come from afar;\nthey fly like the eagle that hastens to eat.",
      "9": "They all come for violence;\ntheir forces advance like the east wind.\n    They gather captives like sand.",
      "10": "They scoff at kings,\n    and they scorn rulers.\nThey deride every stronghold,\n    for they build up siege ramps to capture it.",
      "11": "Then their mind changes,\n    and they transgress and commit offense;\n    their own power is their god.",
      "12": "Are You not from everlasting,\n    O Lord my God, my Holy One? We will not die.\nO Lord, You have appointed them for judgment;\n    and You, O Rock, have established them for correction.",
      "13": "Your eyes are too pure to look on evil,\n    and You cannot look on wickedness.\nWhy do You look on those who deal treacherously,\n    and hold Your tongue when the wicked\n    devours the man who is more righteous than he?",
      "14": "You make men like fish of the sea,\n    like crawling things that have no ruler.",
      "15": "They bring all of them up with a hook,\n    they catch them in their net;\nthey gather them in their dragnet.\n    Therefore they rejoice and are glad.",
      "16": "Therefore they sacrifice to their net\n    and burn incense to their dragnet;\nfor by them their portion is extravagant,\n    and their food plentiful.",
      "17": "Shall they continue to empty their net,\n    and continually kill the nations while not sparing anyone?"

    "2": {
      "1": "I will stand at my watch\n    and station myself on the watchtower;\nand I will keep watch to see what He will say to me,\n    and what I will answer when I am reproved.",
      "2": "And the Lord answered me:\nWrite the vision,\n    and make it plain on tablets,\n    that he who reads it may run.",
      "3": "For the vision is yet for an appointed time;\n    but it speaks of the end,\n    and does not lie.\nIf it delays, wait for it;\n    it will surely come, it will not delay.",
      "4": "Look, his soul is lifted up;\n    it is not upright in him;\n    but the just shall live by his faith.",
      "5": "Indeed, wine betrays the proud man,\n    who does not stay at home.\nHe enlarges his appetite as Sheol,\n    and like death he is never satisfied.\nHe gathers to himself all nations\n    and collects for himself all peoples.",
      "6": "Shall not all these take up a taunt against him, with satire and riddles, and say,\n“Woe to him who increases what is not his—how long?\n    And to him who loads himself with heavy debts!”",
      "7": "Shall not your debtors rise up suddenly,\n    and those awake who oppress you?\n    Then you will be their plunder.",
      "8": "Because you have plundered many nations,\n    all the remnant of the people will plunder you,\nbecause of the bloodshed of men and violence of the land,\n    of the cities and all who live in them.",
      "9": "“Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house,\n    to set his nest on high,\n    to be delivered from the power of calamity!”",
      "10": "You have given shameful counsel to your house\n    by cutting off many peoples,\n    and forfeiting your life.",
      "11": "For the stone will cry out from the wall,\n    and the beam of the woodwork will answer it.",
      "12": "“Woe to him who builds a town with bloodshed\n    and establishes a city on iniquity!”",
      "13": "Is it not from the Lord of Hosts\n    that the people labor to feed fire,\n    and the nations weary themselves for nothing?",
      "14": "For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,\n    as the waters cover the seas.",
      "15": "“Woe to him who makes his neighbor drink,\n    pouring out your poison until they are drunk,\n    that you may look on their nakedness!”",
      "16": "You will be filled with shame instead of glory.\n    You yourself—drink and show your uncircumcision!\nThe cup of the Lord’s right hand will be turned against you,\n    and utter shame will come on your glory!",
      "17": "The violence done to Lebanon will cover you,\n    as will the plunder of beasts that terrified them,\nbecause of the bloodshed of men and violence of the land,\n    of the cities and all who live in them.",
      "18": "What profit is a carved image when its maker has carved it,\n    a cast image, and a teacher of lies,\nthat its maker trusts in what he has shaped\n    when he makes mute idols?",
      "19": "Woe to him who says to the wood, “Awake!”\n    To the silent stone, “Arise!” Can it teach?\nIt is overlaid with gold and silver,\n    and there is no breath at all in it.",
      "20": "But the Lord is in His holy temple.\n    Let all the earth keep silence before Him."

      "1": "A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, on Shigionoth.",
      "2": "O Lord, I have heard the report of You,\n    and was afraid;\nO Lord, revive Your work\n    in the midst of the years!\nIn the midst of these years\n    make them known;\n    in wrath remember mercy.",
      "3": "God came from Teman,\n    and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah\nHis glory covered the heavens,\n    and the earth was full of His praise.",
      "4": "His brightness was like the light;\n    rays flashed from His hand,\n    and there His power was hidden.",
      "5": "Pestilence went out before Him,\n    and plague followed His feet.",
      "6": "He stood and measured the earth;\n    He looked and shook the nations.\nThe eternal mountains were scattered,\n    the perpetual hills bowed.\n    His ways are everlasting.",
      "7": "I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;\n    the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.",
      "8": "Were you displeased with the rivers, O Lord?\n    Was Your anger against the rivers,\nand was Your wrath against the sea\n    when You rode on Your horses,\n    on Your chariots of salvation?",
      "9": "You made bare Your bow;\n    oaths were the arrows at Your command.     Selah\nYou divided the earth with the rivers.",
      "10": "The mountains saw You and trembled;\nthe overflowing water passed by.\n    The deep lifted its voice,\n    and lifted its hands on high.",
      "11": "The sun and moon stood still in their places;\n    at the light of Your arrows they went,\n    at the flash of Your glittering spear.",
      "12": "You marched throughout the earth in indignation;\n    You threshed the nations in anger.",
      "13": "You went forth to deliver Your people,\n    to deliver Your anointed one.\nYou wounded the head of the house of the wicked,\n    laying him bare from head to foot.     Selah",
      "14": "You pierced with his own arrows\n    the leaders of his villages.\nThey came like a whirlwind to scatter me;\n    their rejoicing was like devouring the poor in secret.",
      "15": "You trampled the sea with Your horses,\n    through the wakes of great waters.",
      "16": "I heard, and my body trembled;\n    my lips quivered at the sound;\nrottenness entered my bones;\n    my legs tremble beneath me.\nYet I will wait quietly for the day\n    when calamity comes on the people invading us.",
      "17": "Though the fig tree does not blossom,\n    nor fruit be on the vines;\nthough the yield of the olive fails,\n    and the fields produce no food;\nthough the flocks are cut off from the fold,\n    and there be no herd in the stalls—",
      "18": "yet I will rejoice in the Lord;\n    I will exult in the God of my salvation.",
      "19": "The Lord God is my strength;\n    He will make my feet like hinds’ feet,\n    and He will make me walk on my high places. \nTo the Music Director: with my stringed instruments."
