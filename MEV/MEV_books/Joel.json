      "11": "The Lord has sounded His voice\n    before His army,\nfor His camp is exceedingly great;\n    mighty is the one who accomplishes His word.\nFor great is the day of the Lord,\n    and very awe-inspiring.\n    Who can endure it?",
      "12": "Yet even now, declares the Lord,\n    return to Me with all your heart,\n    and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning.",
      "13": "Rend your heart,\n    and not your garments;\nreturn to the Lord your God,\n    for He is gracious and merciful,\nslow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love;\n    and He relents from punishing.",
      "14": "Who knows? He might turn aside and relent,\n    and He might leave behind a blessing—\na grain offering and a food offering\n    for the Lord your God.",
      "15": "Blow the ram’s horn in Zion,\n    consecrate a fast,\n    call a sacred assembly.",

      "22": "Do not be afraid, beasts of the field,\n    because the wild pastures flourish,\nbecause the tree bears its fruit;\n    the fig tree and the vine yield their abundance.",
      "23": "And children of Zion, exult\n    and rejoice in the Lord your God,\nbecause He has given to you\n    the early rain for vindication.\nHe showers down rains for you,\n    the early rain and the latter rain, as before.",
      "24": "Then the threshing floors will be filled with grain,\n    and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.",
      "25": "And I will compensate you for the years the locusts have eaten—\n    the larval locust, the hopper locust,\n    and the fledging locust—\nMy great army which I sent against you.",
      "26": "You will eat abundantly and be satisfied,\n    and you will praise the name of the Lord your God,\n    who has worked wonders for you;\nand My people will never again be shamed.",
      "27": "Then you will know that I am in the midst of Israel,\n    that I am the Lord your God,\n    and that there is no other.\nAnd My people will never again be shamed.",
      "28": "And it will be that, afterwards,\n    I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh;\nthen your sons and your daughters will prophesy,\n    your old men will dream dreams,\n    and your young men will see visions.",
      "29": "Even on the menservants and maidservants\n    in those days I will pour out My Spirit.",
      "30": "Then I will work wonders in the heavens\n    and the earth—\n    blood and fire and columns of smoke.",
      "31": "The sun will be turned to darkness,\n    and the moon to blood,\n    before the great and awe-inspiring day of the Lord comes.",
      "32": "And it will be that everyone\n    who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\nFor on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem\n    there will be deliverance,\n    as the Lord has said,\nand among the survivors\n    whom the Lord calls."
