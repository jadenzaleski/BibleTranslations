      "4": "youths in whom was no defect, but well-favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and endowed with knowledge, and understanding science, and who had the ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.",
      "5": "The king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at its end they should stand before the king.",
      "6": "Now among these were of the children of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.",

      "10": "The prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths who are of your own age? Then you would endanger my head with the king.”",

      "8": "The king answered, “I know of a certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see the thing has gone from me.",
      "9": "But if you don’t make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the situation changes. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can show me its interpretation.”",
      "10": "The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, “There is not a man on the earth who can show the king’s matter, because no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or Chaldean.",
      "11": "It is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”",

      "15": "He answered Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree so urgent from the king?” Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.",
      "16": "Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.",

      "18": "that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.",
      "19": "Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.",
      "20": "Daniel answered,\n“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever;\n    for wisdom and might are his.",
      "21": "He changes the times and the seasons.\n    He removes kings and sets up kings.\nHe gives wisdom to the wise,\n    and knowledge to those who have understanding.",

      "24": "Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said this to him: “Don’t destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.”",

      "33": "its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.",
      "34": "You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.",
      "35": "Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them. The stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.",

      "39": "“After you, another kingdom will arise that is inferior to you; and another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth.",
      "40": "The fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, it will break in pieces and crush.",
      "41": "Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.",
      "42": "As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong, and partly broken.",
      "43": "Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they will mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they won’t cling to one another, even as iron does not mix with clay.",
      "44": "“In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, nor will its sovereignty be left to another people; but it will break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever.",
      "45": "Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what will happen hereafter. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.”",
      "46": "Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him.",
      "47": "The king answered to Daniel, and said, “Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you have been able to reveal this secret.”",
      "48": "Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.",
      "49": "Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was in the king’s gate."

      "3": "Then the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",

      "43": "But he will have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt. The Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps.",
      "44": "But news out of the east and out of the north will trouble him; and he will go out with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.",
