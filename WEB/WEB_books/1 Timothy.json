      "4": "and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith—",
      "5": "but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith,",
      "6": "from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned away to vain talking,",
      "7": "desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.",

      "14": "The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.",
      "15": "The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.",
      "16": "However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.",

      "5": "constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.",
      "6": "But godliness with contentment is great gain.",

      "9": "But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation, a snare, and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.",
