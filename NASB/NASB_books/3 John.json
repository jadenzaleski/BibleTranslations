      "1": "The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.",
      "2": "Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.",
      "3": "For I was overjoyed when brothers came and testified to your truth, that is, how you are walking in truth.",
      "4": "I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.",
      "5": "Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brothers and sisters, and especially when they are strangers;",
      "6": "and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.",
      "7": "For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.",
      "8": "Therefore we ought to support such people, so that we may prove to be fellow workers with the truth.",
      "9": "I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say.",
      "10": "For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with malicious words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brothers either, and he forbids those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.",
      "11": "Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does what is good is of God; the one who does what is evil has not seen God.",
      "12": "Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we testify too, and you know that our testimony is true.",
      "13": "I had many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with pen and ink;",
      "14": "but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face.",
      "15": "Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name."
