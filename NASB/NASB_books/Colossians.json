      "2": "To the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ who are at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.",
      "3": "We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,",
      "4": "since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints;",
      "5": "because of the hope reserved for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel",
      "6": "which has come to you, just as in all the world also it is bearing fruit and increasing, even as it has been doing in you also since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth;",
      "7": "just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow bond-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,",
      "8": "and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit.",
      "9": "For this reason we also, since the day we heard about it, have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,",
      "10": "so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;",
      "11": "strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all perseverance and patience; joyously",
      "12": "giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.",
      "13": "For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,",
      "14": "in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.",
      "15": "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation:",
      "16": "for by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him.",
      "17": "He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.",
      "18": "He is also the head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything.",
      "19": "For it was the Father’s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him,",
      "20": "and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross.",
      "21": "And although you were previously alienated and hostile in attitude, engaged in evil deeds,",
      "22": "yet He has now reconciled you in His body of flesh through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach—",
      "23": "if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made a minister.",
      "24": "Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am supplementing what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions in behalf of His body, which is the church.",
      "25": "I was made a minister of this church according to the commission from God granted to me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God,",
      "26": "that is, the mystery which had been hidden from the past ages and generations, but now has been revealed to His saints,",
      "27": "to whom God willed to make known what the wealth of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles is, the mystery that is Christ in you, the hope of glory.",
      "28": "We proclaim Him, admonishing every person and teaching every person with all wisdom, so that we may present every person complete in Christ.",
      "29": "For this purpose I also labor, striving according to His power which works mightily within me."

      "1": "For I want you to know how great a struggle I have in your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face,",
      "2": "that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and that they would attain to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God’s mystery, that is, Christ Himself,",
      "3": "in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.",
      "4": "I say this so that no one will deceive you with persuasive arguments.",
      "5": "For even though I am absent in body, I am nevertheless with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your orderly manner and the stability of your faith in Christ.",
      "6": "Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,",
      "7": "having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with gratitude.",
      "8": "See to it that there is no one who takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception in accordance with human tradition, in accordance with the elementary principles of the world, rather than in accordance with Christ.",
      "9": "For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,",
      "10": "and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over every ruler and authority;",
      "11": "and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ,",
      "12": "having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.",
      "13": "And when you were dead in your wrongdoings and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our wrongdoings,",
      "14": "having canceled the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.",
      "15": "When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.",
      "16": "Therefore, no one is to act as your judge in regard to food and drink, or in respect to a festival or a new moon, or a Sabbath day—",
      "17": "things which are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.",
      "18": "Take care that no one keeps defrauding you of your prize by delighting in humility and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,",
      "19": "and not holding firmly to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God.",
      "20": "If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as,",
      "21": "“Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!”",
      "22": "(which all refer to things destined to perish with use)—in accordance with the commandments and teachings of man?",
      "23": "These are matters which do have the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and humility and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence."

    "3": {
      "1": "Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep seeking the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.",
      "2": "Set your minds on the things that are above, not on the things that are on earth.",
      "3": "For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.",
      "4": "When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.",
      "5": "Therefore, treat the parts of your earthly body as dead to sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry.",
      "6": "For it is because of these things that the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience,",
      "7": "and in them you also once walked, when you were living in them.",
      "8": "But now you also, rid yourselves of all of them: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene speech from your mouth.",
      "9": "Do not lie to one another, since you stripped off the old self with its evil practices,",
      "10": "and have put on the new self, which is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created it—",
      "11": "a renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, and free, but Christ is all, and in all.",
      "12": "So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience;",
      "13": "bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so must you do also.",
      "14": "In addition to all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity.",
      "15": "Let the peace of Christ, to which you were indeed called in one body, rule in your hearts; and be thankful.",
      "16": "Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.",
      "17": "Whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.",
      "18": "Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.",
      "19": "Husbands, love your wives and do not become bitter against them.",
      "20": "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.",
      "21": "Fathers, do not antagonize your children, so that they will not become discouraged.",
      "22": "Slaves, obey those who are your human masters in everything, not with eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.",
      "23": "Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord and not for people,",
      "24": "knowing that it is from the Lord that you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.",
      "25": "For the one who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality."

      "4": "that I may make it clear in the way that I ought to proclaim it.",
      "5": "Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity.",
      "6": "Your speech must always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.",
      "7": "As to all my affairs, Tychicus, our beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you information.",
      "8": "For I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts;",
      "9": "and with him is Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of your own. They will inform you about the whole situation here.",

      "11": "and also Jesus who is called Justus; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision, and they have proved to be an encouragement to me.",
