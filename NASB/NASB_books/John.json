      "1": "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.",
      "2": "He was in the beginning with God.",
      "3": "All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being.",
      "4": "In Him was life, and the life was the Light of mankind.",
      "5": "And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not grasp it.",
      "6": "A man came, one sent from God, and his name was John.",
      "7": "He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him.",
      "8": "He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.",
      "9": "This was the true Light that, coming into the world, enlightens every person.",
      "10": "He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, and yet the world did not know Him.",
      "11": "He came to His own, and His own people did not accept Him.",
      "12": "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name,",
      "13": "who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a man, but of God.",
      "14": "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.",
      "15": "John testified about Him and called out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who is coming after me has proved to be my superior, because He existed before me.’”",
      "16": "For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.",
      "17": "For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "No one has seen God at any time; God the only Son, who is in the arms of the Father, He has explained Him.",
      "19": "This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”",
      "20": "And he confessed and did not deny; and this is what he confessed: “I am not the Christ.”",
      "21": "And so they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”",
      "22": "Then they said to him, “Who are you? Tell us, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”",
      "23": "He said, “I am the voice of one calling out in the wilderness, ‘Make the way of the Lord straight,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.”",
      "24": "And the messengers had been sent from the Pharisees.",
      "25": "They asked him, and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”",
      "26": "John answered them, saying, “I baptize in water, but among you stands One whom you do not know.",
      "27": "It is He who comes after me, of whom I am not worthy even to untie the strap of His sandal.”",
      "28": "These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing people.",
      "29": "The next day he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!",
      "30": "This is He in behalf of whom I said, ‘After me is coming a Man who has proved to be my superior, because He existed before me.’",
      "31": "And I did not recognize Him, but so that He would be revealed to Israel, I came baptizing in water.”",
      "32": "And John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him.",
      "33": "And I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’",
      "34": "And I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.”",
      "35": "Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,",
      "36": "and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”",
      "37": "And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.",
      "38": "And Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, “What are you seeking?” They said to Him, “Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?”",
      "39": "He said to them, “Come, and you will see.” So they came and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day; it was about the tenth hour.",
      "40": "One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.",
      "41": "He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which translated means Christ).",
      "42": "He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).",
      "43": "The next day He decided to go to Galilee, and He found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow Me.”",
      "44": "Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.",
      "45": "Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and the prophets also wrote: Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth!”",
      "46": "Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good be from Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”",
      "47": "Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and said of him, “Here is truly an Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!”",
      "48": "Nathanael said to Him, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”",
      "49": "Nathanael answered Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel!”",
      "50": "Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”",
      "51": "And He said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”"

      "1": "On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;",
      "2": "and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.",
      "3": "When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “They have no wine.”",
      "4": "And Jesus said to her, “What business do you have with Me, woman? My hour has not yet come.”",
      "5": "His mother said to the servants, “Whatever He tells you, do it.”",
      "6": "Now there were six stone waterpots standing there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing two or three measures each.",
      "7": "Jesus said to them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.",
      "8": "And He said to them, “Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.” And they took it to him.",
      "9": "Now when the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter called the groom,",
      "10": "and said to him, “Every man serves the good wine first, and when the guests are drunk, then he serves the poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.”",
      "11": "This beginning of His signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.",
      "12": "After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother, and His brothers and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.",
      "13": "The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "14": "And within the temple grounds He found those who were selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables.",
      "15": "And He made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables;",
      "16": "and to those who were selling the doves He said, “Take these things away from here; stop making My Father’s house a place of business!”",
      "17": "His disciples remembered that it was written: “Zeal for Your house will consume me.”",
      "18": "The Jews then said to Him, “What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”",
      "20": "The Jews then said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple, and yet You will raise it up in three days?”",
      "21": "But He was speaking about the temple of His body.",
      "22": "So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.",
      "23": "Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name as they observed His signs which He was doing.",
      "24": "But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, because He knew all people,",
      "25": "and because He did not need anyone to testify about mankind, for He Himself knew what was in mankind."

    "3": {
      "1": "Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;",
      "2": "this man came to Jesus at night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.”",
      "3": "Jesus responded and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”",
      "4": "Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a person be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born, can he?”",
      "5": "Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.",
      "6": "That which has been born of the flesh is flesh, and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’",
      "8": "The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it is coming from and where it is going; so is everyone who has been born of the Spirit.”",
      "9": "Nicodemus responded and said to Him, “How can these things be?”",
      "10": "Jesus answered and said to him, “You are the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?",
      "11": "Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen, and you people do not accept our testimony.",
      "12": "If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?",
      "13": "No one has ascended into heaven, except He who descended from heaven: the Son of Man.",
      "14": "And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,",
      "15": "so that everyone who believes will have eternal life in Him.",
      "16": "“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.",
      "17": "For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.",
      "18": "The one who believes in Him is not judged; the one who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.",
      "19": "And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light; for their deeds were evil.",
      "20": "For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, so that his deeds will not be exposed.",
      "21": "But the one who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds will be revealed as having been performed in God.”",
      "22": "After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea; and there He was spending time with them and baptizing.",
      "23": "Now John also was baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was an abundance of water there; and people were coming and being baptized—",
      "24": "for John had not yet been thrown into prison.",
      "25": "Then a matter of dispute developed on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purification.",
      "26": "And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified—behold, He is baptizing and all the people are coming to Him.”",
      "27": "John replied, “A person can receive not even one thing unless it has been given to him from heaven.",
      "28": "You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent ahead of Him.’",
      "29": "He who has the bride is the groom; but the friend of the groom, who stands and listens to him, rejoices greatly because of the groom’s voice. So this joy of mine has been made full.",
      "30": "He must increase, but I must decrease.",
      "31": "“He who comes from above is above all; the one who is only from the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.",
      "32": "What He has seen and heard, of this He testifies; and no one accepts His testimony.",
      "33": "The one who has accepted His testimony has certified that God is true.",
      "34": "For He whom God sent speaks the words of God; for He does not give the Spirit sparingly.",
      "35": "The Father loves the Son and has entrusted all things to His hand.",
      "36": "The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”"

      "3": "He left Judea and went away again to Galilee.",
      "4": "And He had to pass through Samaria.",
      "5": "So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph;",
      "6": "and Jacob’s well was there. So Jesus, tired from His journey, was just sitting by the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
      "7": "A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.”",
      "8": "For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.",
      "9": "So the Samaritan woman said to Him, “How is it that You, though You are a Jew, are asking me for a drink, though I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)",
      "10": "Jesus replied to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”",
      "11": "She said to Him, “Sir, You have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water?",
      "12": "You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, and his sons and his cattle?”",
      "13": "Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again;",
      "14": "but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”",
      "15": "The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not be thirsty, nor come all the way here to draw water.”",
      "16": "He said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.”",
      "17": "The woman answered and said to Him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have correctly said, ‘I have no husband’;",
      "18": "for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this which you have said is true.”",
      "19": "The woman said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.",
      "20": "Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and yet you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship.”",
      "21": "Jesus said to her, “Believe Me, woman, that a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.",
      "22": "You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, because salvation is from the Jews.",
      "23": "But a time is coming, and even now has arrived, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.",
      "24": "God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”",
      "25": "The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us.”",
      "26": "Jesus said to her, “I am He, the One speaking to you.”",
      "27": "And at this point His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, “What are You seeking?” or, “Why are You speaking with her?”",
      "28": "So the woman left her waterpot and went into the city, and said to the people,",
      "29": "“Come, see a man who told me all the things that I have done; this is not the Christ, is He?”",
      "30": "They left the city and were coming to Him.",
      "31": "Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something.”",
      "32": "But He said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”",
      "33": "So the disciples were saying to one another, “No one brought Him anything to eat, did he?”",
      "34": "Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to accomplish His work.",
      "35": "Do you not say, ‘There are still four months, and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields, that they are white for harvest.",
      "36": "Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together.",
      "37": "For in this case the saying is true: ‘One sows and another reaps.’",
      "38": "I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have come into their labor.”",
      "39": "Now from that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me all the things that I have done.”",
      "40": "So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.",
      "41": "Many more believed because of His word;",

      "43": "And after the two days, He departed from there for Galilee.",
      "44": "For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.",
      "45": "So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, only because they had seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast.",
      "46": "Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.",
      "47": "When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and began asking Him to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.",
      "48": "Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you simply will not believe.”",
      "49": "The royal official said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”",
      "50": "Jesus said to him, “Go; your son is alive.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went home.",
      "51": "And as he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his son was alive.",
      "52": "So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”",
      "53": "So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, “Your son is alive”; and he himself believed, and his entire household.",

      "3": "In these porticoes lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, limping, or paralyzed.",
      "4": "",
      "5": "Now a man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.",

      "9": "Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and began to walk.\nNow it was a Sabbath on that day.",
      "10": "So the Jews were saying to the man who was cured, “It is a Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet.”",
      "11": "But he answered them, “He who made me well was the one who said to me, ‘Pick up your pallet and walk.’”",
      "12": "They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?”",
      "13": "But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place.",
      "14": "Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.”",
      "15": "The man went away, and informed the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.",
      "16": "For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on a Sabbath.",
      "17": "But He answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.”",
      "18": "For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.",
      "19": "Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in the same way.",
      "20": "For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.",
      "21": "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.",
      "22": "For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,",

      "3": "But Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.",
      "4": "Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.",
      "5": "So Jesus, after raising His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him, said to Philip, “Where are we to buy bread so that these people may eat?”",
      "6": "But He was saying this only to test him, for He Himself knew what He intended to do.",
      "7": "Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for them, for each to receive just a little!”",
      "8": "One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,",
      "9": "“There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many people?”",
      "10": "Jesus said, “Have the people recline to eat.” Now there was plenty of grass in the place. So the men reclined, about five thousand in number.",
      "11": "Jesus then took the loaves, and after giving thanks He distributed them to those who were reclining; likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.",
      "12": "And when they had eaten their fill, He said to His disciples, “Gather up the leftover pieces so that nothing will be lost.”",
      "13": "So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.",
      "14": "Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”",
      "15": "So Jesus, aware that they intended to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself, alone.",
      "16": "Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,",
      "17": "and after getting into a boat, they started to cross the sea to Capernaum. It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.",
      "18": "In addition, the sea began getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing.",
      "19": "Then, when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat; and they were frightened.",
      "20": "But He said to them, “It is I; do not be afraid.”",
      "21": "So they were willing to take Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.",
      "22": "The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there except one, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had departed alone.",
      "23": "Other small boats came from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.",
      "24": "So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, looking for Jesus.",
      "25": "And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”",
      "26": "Jesus answered them and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate some of the loaves and were filled.",
      "27": "Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.”",
      "28": "Therefore they said to Him, “What are we to do, so that we may accomplish the works of God?”",
      "29": "Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.”",
      "30": "So they said to Him, “What then are You doing as a sign, so that we may see, and believe You? What work are You performing?",
      "31": "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.’”",
      "32": "Jesus then said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven.",
      "33": "For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.”",
      "34": "Then they said to Him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”",
      "35": "Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty.",
      "36": "But I said to you that you have indeed seen Me, and yet you do not believe.",
      "37": "Everything that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I certainly will not cast out.",
      "38": "For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.",
      "39": "And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of everything that He has given Me I will lose nothing, but will raise it up on the last day.",
      "40": "For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.”",
      "41": "So then the Jews were complaining about Him because He said, “I am the bread that came down out of heaven.”",
      "42": "And they were saying, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, ‘I have come down out of heaven’?”",
      "43": "Jesus answered and said to them, “Stop complaining among yourselves.",
      "44": "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.",
      "45": "It is written in the Prophets: ‘And they shall all be taught of God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father, comes to Me.",
      "46": "Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who is from God; He has seen the Father.",
      "47": "Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life.",
      "48": "I am the bread of life.",
      "49": "Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.",
      "50": "This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so that anyone may eat from it and not die.",
      "51": "I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is My flesh.”",
      "52": "Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”",
      "53": "So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.",
      "54": "The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.",
      "55": "For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.",
      "56": "The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him.",
      "57": "Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, the one who eats Me, he also will live because of Me.",
      "58": "This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; the one who eats this bread will live forever.”",
      "59": "These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.",
      "60": "So then many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, “This statement is very unpleasant; who can listen to it?”",
      "61": "But Jesus, aware that His disciples were complaining about this, said to them, “Is this offensive to you?",
      "62": "What then if you see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?",
      "63": "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh provides no benefit; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and are life.",
      "64": "But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray Him.",
      "65": "And He was saying, “For this reason I have told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.”",
      "66": "As a result of this many of His disciples left, and would no longer walk with Him.",
      "67": "So Jesus said to the twelve, “You do not want to leave also, do you?”",
      "68": "Simon Peter answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.",
      "69": "And we have already believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.”",
      "70": "Jesus answered them, “Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil.”",

      "5": "For not even His brothers believed in Him.",

      "13": "However, no one was speaking openly about Him, for fear of the Jews.",
      "14": "But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple area, and began to teach.",
      "15": "The Jews then were astonished, saying, “How has this man become learned, not having been educated?”",
      "16": "So Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not My own, but His who sent Me.",
      "17": "If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is of God, or I am speaking from Myself.",

      "4": "The two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead, faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first;",
      "5": "and he stooped to look in, and saw the linen wrappings lying there; however he did not go in.",
      "6": "So Simon Peter also came, following him, and he entered the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there,",
      "7": "and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings but folded up in a place by itself.",
      "8": "So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb also entered then, and he saw and believed.",
      "9": "For they did not yet understand the Scripture, that He must rise from the dead.",
      "10": "So the disciples went away again to their own homes.",
      "11": "But Mary was standing outside the tomb, weeping; so as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb;",

      "13": "And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they put Him.”",

      "15": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” Thinking that He was the gardener, she said to Him, “Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you put Him, and I will take Him away.”",
      "16": "Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means, Teacher).",
      "17": "Jesus said to her, “Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.’”",
      "18": "Mary Magdalene came and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that He had said these things to her.",
      "19": "Now when it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were together due to fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and said to them, “Peace be to you.”",
      "20": "And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord.",
      "21": "So Jesus said to them again, “Peace be to you; just as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.”",
      "22": "And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.",
      "23": "If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained.”",
      "24": "But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.",
      "25": "So the other disciples were saying to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.”",
      "26": "Eight days later His disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, “Peace be to you.”",
      "27": "Then He said to Thomas, “Place your finger here, and see My hands; and take your hand and put it into My side; and do not continue in disbelief, but be a believer.”",
      "28": "Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!”",
      "29": "Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen Me, have you now believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed.”",
      "30": "So then, many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;",
      "31": "but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that by believing you may have life in His name."
