      "3": "In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, in accordance with everything that the Lord had commanded him to declare to them,",
      "4": "after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in Edrei.",
      "5": "Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this Law, saying,",
      "6": "“The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain.",
      "7": "Turn and set out on your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Negev, by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.",
      "8": "See, I have placed the land before you; go in and take possession of the land which the Lord swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and their descendants after them.’",

      "11": "May the Lord, the God of your fathers increase you a thousand times more than you are, and bless you, just as He has promised you!",
      "12": "How can I alone endure the burden and weight of you and your strife?",
      "13": "Obtain for yourselves men who are wise, discerning, and informed from your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.’",
      "14": "And you answered me and said, ‘The thing which you have said to do is good.’",
      "15": "So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and informed men, and appointed them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and officers for your tribes.",
      "16": "“Then I ordered your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear the cases between your fellow countrymen and judge righteously between a person and his fellow countryman, or the stranger who is with him.",
      "17": "You are not to show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You are not to be afraid of any person, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too difficult for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.’",
      "18": "At that time I commanded you all the things that you were to do.",

      "22": "“Then all of you approached me and said, ‘Let us send men ahead of us, so that they may spy out the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we should go up, and the cities which we should enter.’",
      "23": "The plan pleased me, and I took twelve of your men, one man for each tribe.",
      "24": "Then they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.",
      "25": "And they took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us. They also brought us back a report and said, ‘The land that the Lord our God is about to give us is good.’",

      "34": "“Then the Lord heard the sound of your words, and He was angry and swore an oath, saying,",
      "35": "‘Not one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land which I swore to give your fathers,",
      "36": "except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him I will give the land on which he has set foot, and to his sons, because he has followed the Lord fully.’",
      "37": "The Lord was angry with me also on your account, saying, ‘Not even you shall enter there.",
      "38": "Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall himself enter there; encourage him, for he will give it to Israel as an inheritance.",
      "39": "Moreover, your little ones who, you said, would become plunder, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good and evil, shall enter there, and I will give it to them and they shall take possession of it.",
      "40": "But as for you, turn around and set out for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.’",
      "41": "“Then you replied to me, ‘We have sinned against the Lord; we ourselves will go up and fight, just as the Lord our God commanded us.’ And every man of you strapped on his weapons of war, and you viewed it as easy to go up into the hill country.",
      "42": "But the Lord said to me, ‘Say to them, “Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; otherwise you will be defeated by your enemies.”’",
      "43": "So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. Instead, you rebelled against the command of the Lord, and acted presumptuously and went up into the hill country.",
      "44": "And the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do, and they scattered you from Seir to Hormah.",
      "45": "Then you returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord did not listen to your voice, nor pay attention to you.",

      "13": "‘Now arise and cross over the Wadi Zered yourselves.’ So we crossed over the Wadi Zered.",
      "14": "Now the time that it took for us to come from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war perished from within the camp, just as the Lord had sworn to them.",
      "15": "Indeed, the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from within the camp until they all perished.",

      "21": "a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim; but the Lord destroyed them before them. And they dispossessed them and settled in their place,",
      "22": "just as He did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; they dispossessed them and settled in their place, where they remain even to this day.",
      "23": "And as for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.)",
      "24": "‘Arise, set out, and pass through the Valley of Arnon. Look! I have handed over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; start taking possession and plunge into battle with him.",
      "25": "This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the faces of people everywhere, who, when they hear the news of you, will tremble and be in anguish because of you.’",
      "26": "“So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,",
      "27": "‘Let me pass through your land; I will travel only on the road. I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.",
      "28": "You will sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink, only let me pass through on foot,",
      "29": "just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross over the Jordan into the land that the Lord our God is giving us.’",
      "30": "But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land; for the Lord your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, in order to hand him over to you, as he is today.",
      "31": "And the Lord said to me, ‘See, I have begun to turn Sihon and his land over to you. Begin taking possession, so that you may possess his land.’",

      "36": "From Aroer which is on the edge of the Valley of Arnon and from the city which is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was no city that was too high for us; the Lord our God turned it all over to us.",

      "3": "So the Lord our God also handed over to us Og, king of Bashan, with all his people, and we struck them until no survivor was left.",
