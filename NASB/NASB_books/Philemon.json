    "1": {
      "1": "Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,\nTo Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker,",
      "2": "and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:",
      "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,",
      "5": "because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints;",
      "6": "and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for the sake of Christ.",
      "7": "For I have had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.",
      "8": "Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper,",
      "9": "yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you—since I am such a person as Paul, an old man, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—",
      "10": "I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I fathered in my imprisonment,",
      "11": "who previously was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.",
      "12": "I have sent him back to you in person, that is, sending my very heart,",
      "13": "whom I wanted to keep with me, so that in your behalf he might be at my service in my imprisonment for the gospel;",
      "14": "but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion, but of your own free will.",
      "15": "For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a while, that you would have him back forever,",
      "16": "no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.",
      "17": "If then you regard me as a partner, accept him as you would me.",
      "18": "But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account;",
      "19": "I, Paul, have written this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).",
      "20": "Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.",
      "21": "Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say.",
      "22": "At the same time also prepare me a guest room, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you.",
      "23": "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,",
      "24": "as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.",
      "25": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
