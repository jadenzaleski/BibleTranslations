    "1": {
      "1": "The word of the Lord which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and which he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Hear, you peoples, all of you;\nListen carefully, earth and all it contains,\nAnd may the Lord God be a witness against you,\nThe Lord from His holy temple.",
      "3": "For behold, the Lord is coming forth from His place.\nHe will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.",
      "4": "The mountains will melt under Him\nAnd the valleys will be split,\nLike wax before the fire,\nLike water poured down a steep place.",
      "5": "All this is due to the wrongdoing of Jacob\nAnd the sins of the house of Israel.\nWhat is the wrongdoing of Jacob?\nIs it not Samaria?\nWhat is the high place of Judah?\nIs it not Jerusalem?",
      "6": "For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country,\nPlanting places for a vineyard.\nI will hurl her stones down into the valley,\nAnd lay bare her foundations.",
      "7": "All of her idols will be crushed,\nAll of her earnings will be burned with fire,\nAnd all of her images I will make desolate;\nFor she collected them from a prostitute’s earnings,\nAnd to the earnings of a prostitute they will return.",
      "8": "Because of this I must mourn and wail,\nI must go barefoot and naked;\nI must do mourning like the jackals,\nAnd a mourning like the ostriches.",
      "9": "For her wound is incurable,\nFor it has come to Judah;\nIt has reached the gate of my people,\nEven to Jerusalem.",
      "10": "Do not tell it in Gath,\nDo not weep at all.\nAt Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself in the dust in mourning.",
      "11": "Go on your way, inhabitant of Shaphir, in shameful nakedness.\nThe inhabitant of Zaanan does not escape.\nThe mourning of Beth-ezel: “He will take from you its support.”",
      "12": "For the inhabitant of Maroth\nWaits for something good,\nBecause a disaster has come down from the Lord\nTo the gate of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Harness the chariot to the team of horses,\nYou inhabitant of Lachish—\nShe was the beginning of sin\nTo the daughter of Zion—\nBecause in you were found\nThe rebellious acts of Israel.",
      "14": "Therefore you will give parting gifts\nIn behalf of Moresheth-gath;\nThe houses of Achzib will become a deception\nTo the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "Moreover, I will bring on you\nThe one who takes possession,\nYou inhabitant of Mareshah.\nThe glory of Israel will enter Adullam.",
      "16": "Shave yourself bald, yes, cut off your hair,\nBecause of the children of your delight;\nExtend your baldness like the eagle,\nFor they will go from you into exile."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Woe to those who devise wrongdoing,\nWho practice evil on their beds!\nWhen morning comes, they do it,\nBecause it is in the power of their hands.",
      "2": "They covet fields, so they seize them;\nAnd houses, so they take them.\nThey exploit a man and his house,\nA person and his inheritance.",
      "3": "Therefore this is what the Lord says:\n“Behold, I am planning against this family a catastrophe\nFrom which you cannot remove your necks;\nAnd you will not walk haughtily,\nFor it will be an evil time.",
      "4": "On that day they will take up against you a song of mocking\nAnd utter a song of mourning and say,\n‘We are completely destroyed!\nHe exchanges the share of my people;\nHow He removes it from me!\nTo the apostate He apportions our fields.’",
      "5": "Therefore you will have no one applying a measuring line\nFor you by lot in the assembly of the Lord.",
      "6": "‘Do not prophesy,’ so they prophesy.\nBut if they do not prophesy about these things,\nInsults will not be turned back.",
      "7": "Is it being said, house of Jacob:\n‘Is the Spirit of the Lord impatient?\nAre these His works?’\nDo My words not do good\nFor the one walking rightly?",
      "8": "Recently My people have arisen as an enemy—\nYou strip the robe off the garment\nFrom unsuspecting passers-by,\nFrom those returned from war.",
      "9": "You evict the women of My people,\nEach one from her pleasant house.\nFrom her children you take My splendor forever.",
      "10": "Arise and go,\nFor this is no place of rest\nBecause of the uncleanness that brings on destruction,\nA painful destruction.",
      "11": "If someone walking after wind and falsehood\nHad lied and said,\n‘I will prophesy to you about wine and liquor,’\nHe would become a prophet to this people.",
      "12": "“I will certainly assemble all of you, Jacob,\nI will certainly gather the remnant of Israel.\nI will put them together like sheep in the fold;\nLike a flock in the midst of its pasture\nThey will be noisy with people.",
      "13": "The one who breaks through goes up before them;\nThey break through, pass through the gate, and go out by it.\nSo their king passes on before them,\nAnd the Lord at their head.”"

    "3": {
      "1": "And I said,\n“Hear now, you leaders of Jacob\nAnd rulers of the house of Israel:\nIs it not for you to know justice?",
      "2": "You who hate good and love evil,\nWho tear off their skin from them\nAnd their flesh from their bones,",
      "3": "Who eat the flesh of my people,\nStrip off their skin from them,\nSmash their bones,\nAnd chop them up as for the pot,\nAnd as meat in a cauldron!”",
      "4": "Then they will cry out to the Lord,\nBut He will not answer them.\nInstead, He will hide His face from them at that time\nBecause they have practiced evil deeds.",
      "5": "This is what the Lord says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray:\nWhen they have something to bite with their teeth,\nThey cry out, “Peace!”\nBut against him who puts nothing in their mouths\nThey declare holy war.",
      "6": "Therefore it will be night for you—without vision,\nAnd darkness for you—without divination.\nThe sun will go down on the prophets,\nAnd the day will become dark over them.",
      "7": "The seers will be put to shame,\nAnd the diviners will be ashamed.\nIndeed, they will all cover their lips\nBecause there is no answer from God.",
      "8": "On the other hand, I am filled with power—\nWith the Spirit of the Lord—\nAnd with justice and courage\nTo make known to Jacob his rebellious act,\nAnd to Israel his sin.",
      "9": "Now hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob\nAnd rulers of the house of Israel,\nWho despise justice\nAnd twist everything that is straight,",
      "10": "Who build Zion with bloodshed,\nAnd Jerusalem with malice.",
      "11": "Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe,\nHer priests teach for pay,\nAnd her prophets divine for money.\nYet they lean on the Lord, saying,\n“Is the Lord not in our midst?\nCatastrophe will not come upon us.”",
      "12": "Therefore on account of you,\nZion will be plowed like a field,\nJerusalem will become a heap of ruins,\nAnd the mountain of the temple will become high places of a forest."

    "4": {
      "1": "And it will come about in the last days\nThat the mountain of the house of the Lord\nWill be established as the chief of the mountains.\nIt will be raised above the hills,\nAnd the peoples will stream to it.",
      "2": "Many nations will come and say,\n“Come and let’s go up to the mountain of the Lord\nAnd to the house of the God of Jacob,\nSo that He may teach us about His ways,\nAnd that we may walk in His paths.”\nFor from Zion will go forth the law,\nAnd the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.",
      "3": "And He will judge between many peoples\nAnd render decisions for mighty, distant nations.\nThen they will beat their swords into plowshares,\nAnd their spears into pruning hooks;\nNation will not lift a sword against nation,\nAnd never again will they train for war.",
      "4": "Instead, each of them will sit under his vine\nAnd under his fig tree,\nWith no one to make them afraid,\nBecause the mouth of the Lord of armies has spoken.",
      "5": "Though all the peoples walk,\nEach in the name of his god,\nAs for us, we will walk\nIn the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.",
      "6": "“On that day,” declares the Lord,\n“I will assemble those who limp\nAnd gather the scattered,\nThose whom I have afflicted.",
      "7": "I will make those who limp a remnant,\nAnd those who have strayed a mighty nation,\nAnd the Lord will reign over them on Mount Zion\nFrom now on and forever.",
      "8": "As for you, tower of the flock,\nHill of the daughter of Zion,\nTo you it will come—\nYes, the former dominion will come,\nThe kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.",
      "9": "“Now, why do you cry out loudly?\nIs there no king among you,\nOr has your counselor perished,\nThat agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth?",
      "10": "Writhe and scream,\nDaughter of Zion,\nLike a woman in childbirth;\nFor now you will go out of the city,\nLive in the field,\nAnd go to Babylon.\nThere you will be rescued,\nThere the Lord will redeem you\nFrom the hand of your enemies.",
      "11": "And now many nations have been assembled against you\nWho say, ‘Let her be defiled,\nAnd let our eyes gloat over Zion!’",
      "12": "But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord,\nAnd they do not understand His plan;\nFor He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.",
      "13": "Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion,\nFor I will make your horn iron,\nAnd I will make your hoofs bronze,\nSo that you may pulverize many peoples,\nAnd dedicate to the Lord their unjust profit,\nAnd their wealth to the Lord of all the earth."

      "3": "Therefore He will give them up until the time\nWhen she who is in labor has given birth.\nThen the remainder of His kinsmen\nWill return to the sons of Israel.",
      "4": "And He will arise and shepherd His flock\nIn the strength of the Lord,\nIn the majesty of the name of the Lord His God.\nAnd they will remain,\nBecause at that time He will be great\nTo the ends of the earth.",
      "5": "This One will be our peace.\nWhen the Assyrian invades our land,\nWhen he tramples on our citadels,\nThen we will raise against him\nSeven shepherds and eight leaders of people.",
      "6": "They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,\nThe land of Nimrod at its entrances;\nAnd He will rescue us from the Assyrian\nWhen he invades our land,\nAnd when he tramples our territory.",
      "7": "Then the remnant of Jacob\nWill be among many peoples\nLike dew from the Lord,\nLike showers on vegetation\nThat do not wait for man,\nOr delay for mankind.",
      "8": "The remnant of Jacob\nWill be among the nations,\nAmong many peoples\nLike a lion among the animals of the forest,\nLike a young lion among flocks of sheep,\nWhich, if he passes through,\nTramples and tears,\nAnd there is no one who can rescue.",
