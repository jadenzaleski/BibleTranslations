      "13": "In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was flashing from the fire.",

      "23": "Under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward the other; each one also had two wings covering its body on the one side and on the other.",
      "24": "And I also heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of abundant waters as they went, like the voice of the Almighty, a sound of a crowd like the sound of an army camp; whenever they stopped, they let down their wings.",
      "25": "And a voice came from above the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood still, they let down their wings.",
      "26": "Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, like lapis lazuli in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne, high up, was a figure with the appearance of a man.",

      "4": "So I am sending you to those who are impudent and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says:’",

      "3": "And He said to me, “Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your body with this scroll which I am giving you.” Then I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.",
      "4": "Then He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them.",

      "6": "nor to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. But I have sent you to the people who understand you;",

      "14": "So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away; and I went embittered in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of the Lord was strong on me.",
      "15": "Then I came to the exiles who lived beside the river Chebar at Tel-abib, and I sat there for seven days where they were living, causing consternation among them.",
      "16": "Now at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",
      "17": "“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from My mouth, warn them from Me.",
      "18": "When I say to the wicked, ‘You will certainly die,’ and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way so that he may live, that wicked person shall die for wrongdoing, but his blood I will require from your hand.",
      "19": "However if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die for wrongdoing, but you have saved yourself.",
      "20": "Again, when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits sin, and I place an obstacle before him, he will die; since you have not warned him, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require from your hand.",
      "21": "However, if you have warned the righteous person that the righteous is not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall certainly live because he took warning; and you have saved yourself.”",
      "22": "Now the hand of the Lord was on me there, and He said to me, “Get up, go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.”",
      "23": "So I got up and went out to the plain; and behold, the glory of the Lord was standing there, like the glory that I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.",
      "24": "But the Spirit entered me and set me up on my feet; and He spoke with me and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house.",
      "25": "And as for you, son of man, they will put ropes around you and bind you with them so that you do not go out among them.",
      "26": "Moreover, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be unable to speak and will not be a man who reprimands them, since they are a rebellious house.",
      "27": "But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you will say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says:’ The one who hears, let him hear; and the one who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house."
