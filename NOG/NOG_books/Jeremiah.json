      "3": "Yahweh also spoke when Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, was king of Judah and during the 11 years that Zedekiah, another son of Josiah, was king of Judah. Yahweh continued to speak to Jeremiah until the people of Jerusalem were taken away into captivity in the fifth month of the year.",
      "4": "Yahweh spoke his word to me,",

      "21": "I planted you like a choice grapevine from the very best seed.\n    Now you have turned against me and have become a wild vine.",
