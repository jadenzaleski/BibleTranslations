    "1": {
      "1": "There was a man named Elkanah from Ramathaim Zophim in the mountains of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, grandson of Elihu, great-grandson of Tohu, whose father was Zuph from the tribe of Ephraim.",
      "2": "Elkanah had two wives, one named Hannah, the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.",
      "3": "Every year this man would go from his own city to worship and sacrifice to Yahweh Tsebaoth at Shiloh. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, served there as priests of Yahweh.",
      "4": "Whenever Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he would give portions of it to his wife Peninnah and all her sons and daughters.",
      "5": "He would also give one portion to Hannah because he loved her, even though Yahweh had kept her from having children.",
      "6": "Because Yahweh had made her unable to have children, her rival Peninnah tormented her endlessly in order to make her miserable.",
      "7": "This happened year after year. Whenever Hannah went to Yahweh’s house, Peninnah would make her miserable, and Hannah would cry and not eat.",
      "8": "Her husband Elkanah would ask her, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why haven’t you eaten? Why are you so downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "One day, after Hannah had something to eat and drink in Shiloh, she got up. (The priest Eli was sitting on a chair by the door of Yahweh’s temple.)",
      "10": "Though she was resentful, she prayed to Yahweh while she cried.",
      "11": "She made this vow, “Yahweh Tsebaoth, if you will look at my misery, remember me, and give me a boy, then I will give him to you for as long as he lives. A razor will never be used on his head.”",
      "12": "While Hannah was praying a long time in front of Yahweh, Eli was watching her mouth.",
      "13": "She was praying silently. Her voice couldn’t be heard; only her lips were moving. Eli thought she was drunk.",
      "14": "“How long are you going to stay drunk?” Eli asked her. “Get rid of your wine.”",
      "15": "Hannah responded, “No sir. I’m not drunk. I’m depressed. I’m pouring out my heart to Yahweh.",
      "16": "Don’t take me to be a good-for-nothing woman. I was praying like this because I’ve been troubled and tormented.”",
      "17": "Eli replied, “Go in peace, and may the Elohim of Israel grant your request.”",
      "18": "“May you continue to be kind to me,” she said. Then the woman went her way and ate. She was no longer sad.",
      "19": "Early in the morning Elkanah and his family got up and worshiped in front of Yahweh. Then they returned home to Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and Yahweh remembered her.",
      "20": "Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel [God Hears], because she said, “I asked Yahweh for him.”",
      "21": "To keep his vow, Elkanah and his entire household again went to offer the annual sacrifice to Yahweh.",
      "22": "But Hannah didn’t go. She told her husband, “I’ll wait until the boy is weaned. Then I’ll bring him and present him to Yahweh, and he’ll stay there permanently.”",
      "23": "“Do what you think is best,” her husband Elkanah told her. “Wait until you’ve weaned him. May Yahweh keep his word.” The woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.",
      "24": "As soon as she had weaned Samuel, she took him with her. She also brought a three-year-old bull, half a bushel of flour, and a full wineskin. She brought him to Yahweh’s house at Shiloh while the boy was still a child.",
      "25": "Then the parents butchered the bull and brought the child to Eli.",
      "26": "“Sir,” Hannah said, “as sure as you live, I’m the woman who stood here next to you and prayed to Yahweh.",
      "27": "I prayed for this child, and Yahweh granted my request.",
      "28": "In return, I am giving him to Yahweh. He will be dedicated to Yahweh for his whole life.”\nAnd they worshiped Yahweh there."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Hannah prayed out loud,\n“My heart finds joy in Yahweh.\nMy head is lifted to Yahweh.\nMy mouth mocks my enemies.\n    I rejoice because you saved me.",
      "2": "There is no one holy like Yahweh.\nThere is no one but you, O Lord.\nThere is no Tsur like our Elohim.",
      "3": "“Do not boast\n    or let arrogance come out of your mouth\n        because Yahweh is an El of knowledge,\n            and he weighs our actions.",
      "4": "“The bows of the warriors are broken,\n    but those who stumble are armed with strength.",
      "5": "Those who were well-fed hire themselves out for a piece of bread,\n    but those who were hungry hunger no more.\n    Even the woman who was childless gives birth to seven children,\n        but the mother of many children grieves all alone.",
      "6": "“Yahweh kills, and he gives life.\nHe makes people go down to the grave, and he raises them up again.",
      "7": "Yahweh causes poverty and grants wealth.\n    He humbles people; he also promotes them.",
      "8": "He raises the poor from the dust.\n    He lifts the needy from the trash heap\n        in order to make them sit with nobles\n            and even to make them inherit a glorious throne.\n“The pillars of the earth are Yahweh’s.\n    He has set the world on them.",
      "9": "He safeguards the steps of his faithful ones,\n    but wicked people are silenced in darkness\n        because humans cannot succeed by their own strength.",
      "10": "“Those who oppose Yahweh are broken into pieces.\n    He thunders at them from the heavens.\nYahweh judges the ends of the earth.\n    He gives strength to his King\n        and lifts the head of his Messiah.”",
      "11": "Then Elkanah went home to Ramah. But the boy Samuel served Yahweh under the priest Eli.",
      "12": "Eli’s sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were good-for-nothing priests; they had no faith in Yahweh.",
      "13": "Now, this was how the priests dealt with the people who were offering sacrifices: While the meat was boiling, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.",
      "14": "Then he would stick it into the pot, kettle, cauldron, or pan. Whatever the fork brought up from the pot belonged to the priest. This is what the priests did in Shiloh to all the people of Israel who came there to sacrifice.",
      "15": "But in the case of Eli’s sons, even before the people burned the fat, their servants would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the meat to the priest to roast. He doesn’t want boiled meat from you. He wants it raw.”",
      "16": "If the man said to the servant, “First let the fat be burned, then take as much as you want,” the servant would say to him, “Give it to me now, or I’ll take it by force.”",
      "17": "The sin of Eli’s sons was a serious matter to Yahweh, because these men were treating the offerings made to Yahweh with contempt.",
      "18": "Meanwhile, Samuel continued to serve in front of Yahweh. As a boy he was already wearing a linen ephod.",
      "19": "His mother would make him a robe and bring it to him every year when she went with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.",
      "20": "Eli would bless Elkanah (and his wife) and say, “May Yahweh give you children from this woman in place of the one which she has given to Yahweh.” Then they would go home.",
      "21": "Yahweh came to Hannah. She became pregnant five times and had three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in front of Yahweh.",
      "22": "Now, Eli was very old, and he had heard everything that his sons were doing to all Israel and that they were sleeping with the women who served at the gate of the tent of meeting.",
      "23": "So he asked them, “Why are you doing such things? I hear about your wicked ways from all these people.",
      "24": "Sons, the report that I hear the people of Yahweh spreading isn’t good!",
      "25": "If one person sins against another, Elohim will take care of him. However, when a person sins against Yahweh, who will pray for him?” But they wouldn’t listen to their father’s warning—Yahweh wanted to kill them.",
      "26": "The boy Samuel continued to grow and gained the favor of Yahweh and the people.",
      "27": "Then a man of Elohim came to Eli and said to him, “This is what Yahweh says: I revealed myself to your ancestors when they were under Pharaoh’s control in Egypt.",
      "28": "I chose one of your ancestors out of all the tribes of Israel to serve as my priest, to sacrifice burnt offerings on my altar, to burn incense, and to wear the ephod in my presence. And I gave your ancestors the right to keep portions of the sacrifices that the people of Israel burned on the altar.",
      "29": "Why do you show no respect for my sacrifices and grain offerings that I have commanded people to make in my dwelling place? Why do you honor your sons more than me by making yourselves fat on the best of all the sacrifices offered by my people Israel?",
      "30": "“Therefore, Yahweh Elohim of Israel declares: I certainly thought that your family and your father’s family would always live in my presence.\n“But now Yahweh declares: I promise that I will honor those who honor me, and those who despise me will be considered insignificant.",
      "31": "The time is coming when I will break your strength and the strength of your father’s house so that no one will grow old in your family.",
      "32": "You will see distress in my dwelling place. In spite of the good that I do for Israel, no one in your family will live to an old age.",
      "33": "Any man in your family whom I do not remove from my altar will have his eyes fail, and he will be heartbroken. And all your descendants will die in the prime of life.",
      "34": "What is going to happen to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you: Both of them will die on the same day.",
      "35": "Then I will appoint a faithful priest to serve me. He will do everything I want him to do. I will give him faithful descendants, and he will always live as my anointed one.",
      "36": "Then anyone who is left from your household will bow down in front of him to get a coin or a loaf of bread and say, ‘Please appoint me to one of the priestly classes so that I may eat a piece of bread.’”"

    "3": {
      "1": "The boy Samuel was serving Yahweh under Eli. In those days a prophecy from Yahweh was rare; visions were infrequent.",
      "2": "One night Eli was lying down in his room. His eyesight had begun to fail so that he couldn’t see well.",
      "3": "The lamp in Elohim’s temple hadn’t gone out yet, and Samuel was asleep in the temple of Yahweh where the ark of Elohim was kept.",
      "4": "Then Yahweh called Samuel. “Here I am,” Samuel responded.",
      "5": "He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am. You called me.”\n“I didn’t call you,” Eli replied. “Go back to bed.” So Samuel went back and lay down.",
      "6": "Yahweh called Samuel again. Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am. You called me.”\n“I didn’t call you, son,” he responded. “Go back to bed.”",
      "7": "Samuel had no experience with Yahweh, because the word of Yahweh had not yet been revealed to him.",
      "8": "Yahweh called Samuel a third time. Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am. You called me.”\nThen Eli realized that Yahweh was calling the boy.",
      "9": "“Go, lie down,” Eli told Samuel. “When he calls you, say, ‘Speak, Yahweh. I’m listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his room.",
      "10": "Yahweh came and stood there. He called as he had called the other times: “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel replied, “Speak. I’m listening.”",
      "11": "Then Yahweh said to Samuel, “I am going to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears it ring.",
      "12": "On that day I am going to do to Eli and his family everything I said from beginning to end.",
      "13": "I told him that I would hand down a permanent judgment against his household because he knew about his sons’ sin—that they were cursing God—but he didn’t try to stop them.",
      "14": "That is why I have taken an oath concerning Eli’s family line: No offering or sacrifice will ever be able to make peace for the sins that Eli’s family committed.”",
      "15": "Samuel remained in bed until morning. Then he opened the doors of Yahweh’s house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.",
      "16": "Then Eli called Samuel. “Samuel, my son!” he said.\n“Here I am,” he responded.",
      "17": "“What did Yahweh tell you?” he asked. “Please don’t hide anything from me. May Elohim strike you dead if you hide anything he told you from me.”",
      "18": "So Samuel told Eli everything.\nEli replied, “He is Yahweh. May he do what he thinks is right.”",
      "19": "Samuel grew up. Yahweh was with him and didn’t let any of his words go unfulfilled.",
      "20": "All Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew Samuel was Yahweh’s appointed prophet.",
      "21": "Yahweh continued to appear in Shiloh, since Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of Yahweh. And Samuel spoke to all Israel."

      "1": "Israel went to fight against the Philistines and camped near Ebenezer while the Philistines camped at Aphek.",
      "2": "The Philistines organized their troops to meet Israel in battle. As the battle spread, the Philistines defeated Israel and killed about 4,000 soldiers in the field.",
      "3": "When the troops came back to the camp, the leaders of Israel asked, “Why has Yahweh used the Philistines to defeat us today? Let’s get the ark of Yahweh’s promise from Shiloh so that he may be with us and save us from our enemies.”",
      "4": "The troops sent some men who brought back the ark of the promise of Yahweh Tsebaoth—who is enthroned over the angels. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, came along with Elohim’s ark.",
      "5": "When Yahweh’s ark came into the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth rang with echoes.",
      "6": "As the Philistines heard the noise, they asked, “What’s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?” The Philistines found out that Yahweh’s ark had come into the camp.",
      "7": "Then they were frightened and said, “A god has come into their camp.” They also said, “Oh no! Nothing like this has ever happened before.",
      "8": "We’re in trouble now! Who can save us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every kind of plague in the desert.",
      "9": "Be strong, Philistines, and act like men, or else you will serve the Hebrews as they served you. Act like men and fight.”",
      "10": "The Philistines fought and defeated Israel. Every Israelite soldier fled to his tent. It was a major defeat in which 30,000 Israelite foot soldiers died.",
      "11": "The ark of Elohim was captured. Both of Eli’s sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.",
      "12": "A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the front line of the battle. He went to Shiloh that day with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.",
      "13": "When he arrived, Eli was sitting on a chair beside the road, watching. He was worried about the ark of Elohim. The man went into the city to tell the news. The whole city cried out.",

      "17": "“Israel fled from the Philistines,” the messenger answered. “Our troops suffered heavy casualties. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, also are dead, and the ark of Elohim has been captured.”",
      "18": "When the messenger mentioned the ark of Elohim, Eli fell from his chair backwards toward the gate. He broke his neck, and he died. (The man was old and heavy.) He had judged Israel for 40 years.",
      "19": "His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was pregnant. When she heard the news that the ark of Elohim had been captured and her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor prematurely and gave birth to a son.",
      "20": "As she was dying, the women helping her said, “Don’t be afraid. You’ve given birth to a son.” But she didn’t answer or pay attention.",

      "2": "They brought it into the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon.",
      "3": "Early the next day the people of Ashdod saw that Dagon had fallen forward on the ground in front of Yahweh’s ark. So they took Dagon and put him back in his place.",
      "4": "But the next morning they saw that Dagon had again fallen forward on the ground in front of Yahweh’s ark. Dagon’s head and his two hands were cut off and were lying on the temple’s threshold. The rest of Dagon’s body was intact.",
      "5": "This is why the priests of Dagon and everyone else who comes into Dagon’s temple in Ashdod still don’t step on the temple’s threshold.",
      "6": "Yahweh dealt harshly with the people of Ashdod. He destroyed them by striking the people in the vicinity of Ashdod with tumors.",
      "7": "When the people of Ashdod realized what was happening, they said, “The ark of the Elohim of Israel must not stay with us, because their Elohim is dealing harshly with us and our god Dagon.”",
      "8": "The people of Ashdod called together all the Philistine rulers. “What should we do with the ark of the Elohim of Israel?” they asked.\n“The ark of the Elohim of Israel must be taken to Gath,” the rulers said. So the people took the ark of the Elohim of Israel there.",
      "9": "But after they had moved it, Yahweh threw the city into a great panic: He struck all the important and unimportant people in the city, and they were covered with tumors.",
      "10": "So the people of Gath sent the ark of Elohim to Ekron. But when the ark of Elohim came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They brought the ark of the Elohim of Israel here to kill us.”",
      "11": "They called together all the Philistine rulers. “Send the ark of the Elohim of Israel away,” they said. “Let it go back to its own place so that it won’t kill us or our people.” There was a fear of death throughout the city, where Elohim dealt with them very harshly.",

      "3": "The priests answered, “If you’re returning the ark of the Elohim of Israel, don’t send it away empty, but by all means return it to its proper place with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will know why he would not turn his anger away from you.”",
      "4": "The Philistines asked, “What kind of guilt offering should we give him?”\nThe priests answered, “Five gold tumors and five gold mice for the five Philistine rulers because all of you and your rulers suffer from the same plague.",
      "5": "Make models of your tumors and your mice which are destroying the country, and give glory to the Elohim of Israel. Maybe he will no longer be so hard on you, your gods, and your country.",

      "9": "but then watch where it goes. If it goes up the road to its own country toward Beth Shemesh, then this disaster is Yahweh’s doing. But if not, we’ll know it wasn’t his hand that struck us, but what happened to us was an accident.”",
      "10": "The people did this. They took two dairy cows, hitched them to a cart, and shut the calves in the stall.",
      "11": "They put the ark of Yahweh and the box containing the gold mice and the models of their hemorrhoids on the cart.",
      "12": "The cows went straight up the road to Beth Shemesh. Continually mooing, they stayed on the road and didn’t turn right or left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth Shemesh.",

      "5": "When they came to the territory of Zuph, Saul told his servant who was with him, “Let’s go back, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and worry about us instead.”",
      "6": "The servant responded, “There’s a man of Elohim in this city, a highly respected man. Everything he says is sure to happen. Let’s go there. Maybe he’ll tell us which way we should go.”",
      "7": "“If we go,” Saul asked his servant, “what could we bring the man since the food in our sacks is gone? There’s no present we can bring the man of Elohim. What do we have?”",
      "8": "The servant again answered Saul, “Look, here! I have one-tenth of an ounce of silver. I’ll give it to the man of Elohim. Then he’ll tell us where to find the donkeys.”",

      "13": "As you go into the city, you can find him before he goes to the worship site to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, since he blesses the sacrifice. Then those who are invited may eat. Go. You should be able to find him now.”",

      "8": "Now, be kind to me. After all, you forced me into an agreement with Yahweh. If I have committed any crime, kill me yourself. Why bother taking me to your father?”",

      "20": "I will shoot three arrows from beside it toward a target.",
      "21": "Then I will send out a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ Now, if I tell the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are next to you; get them,’ then come back with me. You will be safe, and there will be no trouble. I swear it, as Yahweh lives.",
      "22": "But if I tell the boy, ‘The arrows are next to you,’ then go, because Yahweh has sent you away.",

      "29": "David said to me ‘Please let me go. Our relatives will offer a sacrifice in the city, and my brother ordered me to be there. If you will permit it, please let me go to see my brothers.’ This is why he hasn’t come to your banquet.”",
      "30": "Then Saul got angry with Jonathan. “Son of a crooked and rebellious woman!” he called Jonathan. “I know you’ve sided with Jesse’s son. You have no shame. You act as if you are your mother’s son but not mine.",
      "31": "As long as Jesse’s son lives on earth, neither you nor your right to be king is secure. Now, send some men to bring him to me. He’s a dead man!”",
      "32": "Jonathan asked his father, “Why should he be killed? What has he done?”",
      "33": "Saul raised his spear to strike him. Then Jonathan knew his father was determined to kill David.",
      "34": "Jonathan got up from the table very angry and ate nothing that second day of the month. He was worried sick about David because Jonathan had been humiliated by his own father.",
      "35": "In the morning Jonathan went out to the country to the place he and David had agreed on. Jonathan had a young boy with him.",
      "36": "“Run,” he told the boy, “please find the arrows I shoot.”\nThe boy ran, and Jonathan shot the arrow over him.",
      "37": "When the boy reached the place where Jonathan’s arrow had landed, Jonathan called after him, “The arrows are next to you!”",
      "38": "Jonathan added, “Quick! Hurry up! Don’t stand there!” Jonathan’s young servant gathered the arrows and came to his master.",
      "39": "The boy had no idea what was going on, but Jonathan and David understood.",
      "40": "Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy. He told the boy, “Take them back into town.”",
      "41": "When the boy had left, David came out from the south side of the rock and quickly bowed down three times with his face touching the ground. Then they kissed each other and cried together, but David cried the loudest.",
      "42": "“Go in peace!” Jonathan told David. “We have both taken an oath in Yahweh’s name, saying, ‘Yahweh will be a witness between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’”\nSo David left, and Jonathan went into the city."

      "6": "David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai, who was Zeruiah’s son and Joab’s brother, “Who will go with me to Saul in the camp?”\nAbishai answered, “I’ll go with you.”",
      "7": "So David and Abishai went among Saul’s troops that night. Saul was lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.",
      "8": "Abishai said to David, “Today Elohim has turned your enemy over to you. Please let me nail him to the ground with one stab of the spear. I won’t have to do it twice!”",
      "9": "“Don’t kill him!” David told Abishai. “No one has ever attacked Yahweh’s anointed king and remained free of guilt.",
      "10": "I solemnly swear, as Yahweh lives,” David added, “Yahweh will strike him. Either his time will come when he’ll die naturally, or he’ll go into battle and be swept away.",
      "11": "It would be unthinkable for me to attack Yahweh’s anointed king. But please take that spear near his head and that jar of water, and let’s go.”",
      "12": "David took the spear and the jar of water near Saul’s head, and they left. All of them were asleep. No one saw them, knew about it, or woke up. Yahweh had made them fall into a deep sleep.",
      "13": "David went over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away. (There was a wide space between them.)",
      "14": "Then David called to the troops and to Ner’s son Abner. “Won’t you answer, Abner?” he asked.\n“Who is calling the king?” Abner asked.",
      "15": "David asked Abner, “Aren’t you a man? Is there anyone like you in Israel? Then why didn’t you guard your master, the king? Someone came to kill His Royal Majesty.",
      "16": "What you’ve done isn’t good. I solemnly swear, as Yahweh lives, you are dead men. You didn’t guard your master, Yahweh’s anointed king. Look at the king’s spear and the jar of water that were near his head.”",
      "17": "Saul recognized David’s voice. “Is that your voice, my servant David?” he asked.\n“It is my voice, Your Royal Majesty,” David answered.",
      "18": "“Why are you pursuing me?” he added. “What have I done? What crime have I committed?",
      "19": "Your Majesty, please listen to my words. If Yahweh has turned you against me, let him be satisfied with an offering. But if mere mortals have turned you against me, let them be cursed by Yahweh. They have prevented me from having a share of Yahweh’s inheritance. ‘Go and serve other gods,’ they tell me.",
      "20": "Don’t let my blood fall to the ground, away from Yahweh’s presence. The king of Israel has come to search for one flea like someone hunting a partridge in the hills.”",
      "21": "“My servant David,” Saul said, “I have sinned. Come back. I will not harm you again, because you valued my life today. I’ve acted like a fool and made a terrible mistake.”",
      "22": "David responded, “Here’s the king’s spear. One of the young men should come over and get it.",
      "23": "Yahweh will reward any person who is righteous and faithful. Yahweh handed you over to me today, but I refused to attack Yahweh’s anointed king.",
      "24": "As I placed great value on your life today, may Yahweh place great value on my life and rescue me from all trouble.”",
      "25": "Then Saul said, “Blessed are you, my servant David. You will accomplish many things and certainly will succeed.”\nSo David went his way, while Saul returned home."

      "1": "David said to himself, “One of these days Saul will sweep me away. The best thing for me to do is to make sure that I escape to Philistine territory. Then Saul will give up looking all over Israel for me, and I’ll escape from him.”",
      "2": "So David went with his 600 men to King Achish of Gath, Moach’s son.",
      "3": "David and his men stayed with Achish in Gath. Each one had his family, and David had his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail (who had been Nabal’s wife) from Carmel.",
      "4": "When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he didn’t search for him anymore.",
      "5": "David said to Achish, “If you will permit me, let me have a place in one of the outlying towns so that I can live there. Why should I live in the royal city with you?”",
      "6": "So Achish immediately gave him Ziklag. (This is why Ziklag still belongs to the kings of Judah today.)",
      "7": "David stayed in Philistine territory for one year and four months.",
      "8": "Then David and his men went to raid the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (They lived in the territory which extends from Telaim to Shur and Egypt.)",
      "9": "Whenever David attacked the territory, he left no man or woman alive. He also took sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing and returned to Achish.",
      "10": "Achish would ask, “Whom did you raid today?”\nAnd David would answer, “the Negev in Judah,” or “the portion of the Negev where the descendants of Jerahmeel live,” or “the portion of the Negev where the Kenites live.”",
      "11": "He did not bring a single man or woman back to Gath alive. He thought, “They could tell Achish what I really did.” This was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory.",
      "12": "And Achish believed David. Achish thought, “He has definitely made his own people in Israel despise him. He’ll be my servant from now on.”"

      "3": "Meanwhile, Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his hometown Ramah. (Saul had rid the land of mediums and psychics.)",
      "4": "The Philistines assembled and camped in Shunem. Saul also assembled the whole Israelite army, and they camped at Gilboa.",
      "5": "When Saul looked at the Philistine army, he was very afraid—terrified.",

      "10": "But Saul took an oath in Yahweh’s name, “I solemnly swear, as Yahweh lives, you will not be harmed if you do this.”",
      "11": "“Whom should I conjure up for you?” the woman asked.\n“Conjure up Samuel for me,” he answered.",
      "12": "When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out loudly and asked, “Why did you deceive me? You’re Saul!”",
      "13": "“Don’t be afraid,” the king said to her. “What do you see?”\n“I see a god rising from the ground,” the woman answered.",
      "14": "“In what form?” he asked her.\nShe answered, “An old man is coming up, and he’s wearing a robe.” Then Saul knew it was Samuel. Saul knelt down with his face touching the ground.",
      "15": "Samuel asked Saul, “Why did you disturb me by conjuring me up?”\nSaul answered, “I’m in serious trouble. The Philistines are at war with me, and Elohim has turned against me and doesn’t answer me anymore—either by the prophets or in dreams. So I’ve called on you to tell me what to do.”",
      "16": "Samuel said, “Why are you asking me when Yahweh has turned against you and become your enemy?",
      "17": "Yahweh has done to you exactly what he spoke through me: Yahweh has torn the kingship out of your hands and given it to your fellow Israelite David.",
      "18": "Yahweh is doing this to you today because you didn’t listen to him or unleash his burning anger on Amalek.",
      "19": "For the same reasons Yahweh will hand you and Israel over to the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. And then Yahweh will hand Israel’s army over to the Philistines.”",
      "20": "Immediately, Saul fell flat on the ground. He was frightened by Samuel’s words. He also had no strength left, because he hadn’t eaten anything all day or all night.",
      "21": "The woman came over to Saul and saw that he was terrified. “I listened to you,” she told him, “and I took my life in my hands when I did what you told me to do.",
      "22": "Now please listen to me. I will serve you something to eat. Eat it so that you will have strength when you leave.”",
      "23": "But he refused. “I don’t want to eat,” he said. Nevertheless, his officers and the woman kept urging him until he listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.",
      "24": "The woman immediately butchered a fattened calf that she owned. She took flour, kneaded it, and baked some unleavened bread.",

      "4": "But the Philistine officers were angry with Achish. “Send the man back,” the Philistine officers told him. “Return him to the place you assigned him. He shouldn’t go with us into battle. He shouldn’t be allowed to become our enemy during the battle. Is this man going to try to regain his master’s favor? He’ll do it with the lives of our men!",

      "7": "So leave peacefully without doing anything to displease the Philistine rulers.”",
