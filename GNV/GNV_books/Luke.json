      "42": "And she cried with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, because the fruit of thy womb is blessed.",
      "43": "And whence cometh this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?",
      "44": "For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe sprang in my belly for joy.",

      "62": "Then they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.",
      "63": "So he asked for writing tablets, and wrote, saying, His name is John, and they marveled all.",
      "64": "And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake and praised God.",
      "65": "Then fear came on all them that dwelt near unto them, and all these words were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea.",
      "66": "And all they that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner child shall this be! and the hand of the Lord was with him.",
      "67": "Then his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,",

      "72": "That he might show mercy towards our fathers: and remember his holy covenant,",
      "73": "And the oath, which he sware to our father Abraham.",
      "74": "Which was, that he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, should serve him without fear,",
      "75": "All the days of our life, in holiness and righteousness before him.",
      "76": "And thou, babe, shalt be called the Prophet of the most High: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,",
      "77": "And to give knowledge of salvation unto his people, by the remission of their sins,",
      "78": "Through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,",
      "79": "To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, and to guide our feet into the way of peace.",
