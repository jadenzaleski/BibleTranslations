      "1": "The Elder to the elect Lady, and her children, whom I love in the truth: and not I only, but also all that have known the truth,",
      "2": "For the truth’s sake which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us forever:",
      "3": "Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, with truth and love.",
      "4": "I rejoiced greatly, that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment of the Father.",
      "5": "And now beseech I thee, Lady, (not as writing a new commandment unto thee, but the same which we had from the beginning) that we love one another.",
      "6": "And this is that love that we should walk after his commandments. This commandment is, that as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.",
      "7": "For many deceivers are entered into this world, which confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. He that is such one, is a deceiver and an Antichrist.",
      "8": "Look to yourselves, that we lose not the things, which we have done, but that we may receive a full reward.",
      "9": "Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.",
      "10": "If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not to house, neither bid him Godspeed.",
      "11": "For he that biddeth him Godspeed, is partaker of his evil deeds. Although I had many things to write unto you, yet would I not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full.",
      "12": "The sons of thine elect sister greet thee, Amen."
