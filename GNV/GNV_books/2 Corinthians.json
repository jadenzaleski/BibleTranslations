      "1": "PAUL an Apostle of JESUS Christ, by the will of God, and our brother Timothy, to the Church of God, which is at Corinth, with all the Saints, which are in all Achaia:",
      "2": "Grace be with you, and peace from God, our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "3": "Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort,",
      "4": "Which comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any affliction by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.",
      "5": "For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation aboundeth through Christ.",
      "6": "And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is wrought in the enduring of the same sufferings, which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.",
      "7": "And our hope is steadfast concerning you, in as much as we know, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.",
      "8": "For brethren, we would not have you ignorant of our affliction, which came unto us in Asia, how we were pressed out of measure passing strength, so that we altogether doubted even of life.",
      "9": "Yea, we received the sentence of death in ourselves, because we should not rest in ourselves, but in God, which raised the dead.",
      "10": "Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver us: in whom we trust, that yet hereafter he will deliver us.",
      "11": "So that ye labor together in prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us for many, thanks may be given by many persons for us.",
      "12": "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly pureness, and not in fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God we have had our conversation in the world, and most of all to youwards.",
      "13": "For we write none other things unto you, than that ye read or else that ye acknowledge, and I trust ye shall acknowledge unto the end.",
      "14": "Even as ye have acknowledged us partly, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.",
      "15": "And in this confidence was I minded first to come unto you, that ye might have had a double grace,",
      "16": "And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia, unto you, and to be led forth toward Judea of you.",
      "17": "When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or mind I those things which I mind, according to the flesh, that with me should be, Yea, yea, and Nay, nay?",
      "18": "Yea, God is faithful, that our word toward you, was not Yea, and Nay?",
      "19": "For the Son of God Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, that is, by me, and Silvanus, and Timothy, was not Yea, and Nay: but in him it was Yea.",
      "20": "For all the promises of God in him are Yea, and are in him Amen, unto the glory of God through us.",
      "21": "And it is God which established us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us.",
      "22": "Who hath also sealed us, and hath given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.",
      "23": "Now, I call God for a record unto my soul, that to spare you, I came not as yet unto Corinth.",
      "24": "Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand."

      "1": "But I determined thus in myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.",
      "2": "For if I make you sorry, who is he then that should make me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?",
      "3": "And I wrote this same thing unto you, lest when I came, I should take heaviness of them of whom I ought to rejoice: this confidence have I in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.",
      "4": "For in great affliction, and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears: not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might perceive the love which I have, specially unto you.",
      "5": "And if any hath caused sorrow, the same hath not made me sorry, but partly (lest I should more charge him) you all.",
      "6": "It is sufficient unto the same man, that he was rebuked of many.",
      "7": "So that now contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest the same should be swallowed up with overmuch heaviness.",
      "8": "Wherefore, I pray you, that you would confirm your love towards him.",
      "9": "For this cause also did I write: that I might know the proof of you, whether ye would be obedient in all things.",
      "10": "To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for verily if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the sight of Christ,",
      "11": "Lest Satan should circumvent us: for we are not ignorant of his enterprises.",
      "12": "Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s Gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,",
      "13": "I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother, but took my leave of them, and went away into Macedonia.",
      "14": "Now thanks be unto God, which always maketh us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place.",
      "15": "For we are unto God the sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them which perish.",
      "16": "To the one we are the savor of death, unto death, and to the other the savor of life, unto life: and who is sufficient for these things?",
      "17": "For we are not as many, which make merchandise of the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God in the sight of God speak we in Christ."

    "3": {
      "1": "Do we begin to praise ourselves again? or need we as some others, Epistles of recommendation unto you, or letters of recommendation from you?",
      "2": "Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is understood and read of all men,",
      "3": "In that ye are manifest, to be the Epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.",
      "4": "And such trust have we through Christ to God:",
      "5": "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to think anything, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is of God,",
      "6": "Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.",
      "7": "If then the ministration of death written with letters and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance (which glory is gone away.)",
      "8": "How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be more glorious?",
      "9": "For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.",
      "10": "For even that which was glorified, was not glorified in this point, that is, as touching the exceeding glory.",
      "11": "For if that they should be abolished, was glorious, much more shall that which remaineth be glorious.",
      "12": "Seeing then that we have such trust, we use great boldness of speech.",
      "13": "And we are not as Moses, which put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look unto the end of that which should be abolished.",
      "14": "Therefore their minds are hardened: for until this day remaineth the same covering untaken away in the reading of the old Testament, which veil in Christ is put away.",
      "15": "But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is laid over their hearts.",
      "16": "Nevertheless when their heart shall be turned to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.",
      "17": "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.",
      "18": "But we all behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord with open face, and are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Therefore, seeing that we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not:",
      "2": "But have cast from us the cloaks of shame, and walk not in craftiness, neither handle we the word of God deceitfully: but in declaration of the truth we approve ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.",
      "3": "If the Gospel be then hid, it is hid to them that are lost.",
      "4": "In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds, that is, of the infidels, that the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine unto them.",
      "5": "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.",
      "6": "For God that commanded the light to shine out of darkness, is he which hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.",
      "7": "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of that power might be of God, and not of us.",
      "8": "We are afflicted on every side, yet are we not in distress: we are in doubt, but yet we despair not.",
      "9": "We are persecuted, but not forsaken: cast down, but we perish not.",
      "10": "Everywhere we bear about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus might also be made manifest in our bodies.",
      "11": "For we which live, are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.",
      "12": "So then death worketh in us, and life in you.",
      "13": "And because we have the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken, we also believe, and therefore speak,",
      "14": "Knowing that he which hath raised up the Lord Jesus, shall raise us up also by Jesus, and shall set us with you.",
      "15": "For all things are for your sakes, that that most plenteous grace by the thanksgiving of many, may redound to the praise of God.",
      "16": "Therefore we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed daily.",
      "17": "For our light affliction which is but for a moment, causeth unto us a far most excellent and an eternal weight of glory:",
      "18": "While we look not on the things which are seen, but on the things which are not seen for the things which are seen, are temporal: but the things which are not seen, are eternal."
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be destroyed, we have a building given of God, that is, an house not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens.",
      "2": "For therefore we sigh, desiring to be clothed with our house, which is from heaven.",
      "3": "Because that if we be clothed, we shall not be found naked.",
      "4": "For indeed we that are in this tabernacle, sigh and are burdened because we would not be unclothed, but would be clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.",
      "5": "And he that hath created us for this thing, is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.",
      "6": "Therefore we are always bold, though we know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.",
      "7": "(For we walk by faith, and not by sight.)",
      "8": "Nevertheless, we are bold, and love rather to remove out of the body, and to dwell with the Lord.",
      "9": "Wherefore also we covet, that both dwelling at home, and removing from home, we may be acceptable to him.",
      "10": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every man may receive the things which are done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil.",
      "11": "Knowing therefore that terror of the Lord, we persuade men, and we are made manifest unto God, and I trust also that we are made manifest in your consciences.",
      "12": "For we praise not ourselves again unto you, but give you an occasion to rejoice of us that ye may have to answer against them, which rejoice in the face, and not in the heart.",
      "13": "For whether we be out of our wit, we are it to God: or whether we be in our right mind, we are it unto you.",
      "14": "For that love of Christ constraineth us,",
      "15": "Because we thus judge, that if one be dead for all, then were all dead, and he died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.",
      "16": "Wherefore, henceforth know we no man after the flesh, yea though we had known Christ after the flesh, yet not henceforth know we him no more.",
      "17": "Therefore if any man be in Christ, let him be a new creature. Old things are passed away: behold, all things are become new.",
      "18": "And all things are of God, which hath reconciled us unto himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given unto us the ministry of reconciliation.",
      "19": "For God was in Christ, and reconciled the world to himself, not imputing their sins unto them, and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation.",
      "20": "Now then are we ambassadors for Christ: as though God did beseech you through us, we pray you in Christ’s stead, that ye be reconciled to God.",
      "21": "For he hath made him to be sin for us, which knew no sin, that we should be made the righteousness of God in him."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "So we therefore as workers together beseech you, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.",
      "2": "For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succored thee: behold now the accepted time, behold now the day of salvation.",
      "3": "We give no occasion of offence in anything, that our ministry should not be reprehended.",
      "4": "But in all things we approve ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses.",
      "5": "In stripes, in prisons, in tumults, in labors,",
      "6": "By watchings, by fastings, by purity, by knowledge, by long suffering, by kindness, by the holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,",
      "7": "By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand, and on the left,",
      "8": "By honor, and dishonor, by evil report, and good report, as deceivers, and yet true:",
      "9": "As unknown, and yet known: as dying, and behold, we live, as chastened, and yet not killed:",
      "10": "As sorrowing, and yet always rejoicing: as poor, and yet making many rich: as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.",
      "11": "O Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is made large.",
      "12": "Ye are not kept strait in us, but ye are kept strait in your own bowels.",
      "13": "Now for the same recompense, I speak as to my children, Be you also enlarged.",
      "14": "Be not unequally yoked with the infidels: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?",
      "15": "And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath the believer with the infidel?",
      "16": "And what agreement hath the Temple of God with idols? for ye are the Temple of the living God: as God hath said, I will dwell among them, and walk there: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.",
      "17": "Wherefore come out from among them, and separate yourselves, saith the Lord, and touch none unclean thing, and I will receive you.",

      "3": "I speak it not to your condemnation: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts, to die and live together.",
      "4": "I use great boldness of speech toward you: I rejoice greatly in you: I am filled with comfort, and am exceeding joyous in all our tribulation.",
      "5": "For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side, fightings without, and terrors within.",
      "6": "But God, that comforteth the abject, comforted us at the coming of Titus:",
      "7": "And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted of you, when he told us your great desire, your mourning, your fervent mind to me-ward, so that I rejoiced much more.",
      "8": "For though I made you sorry with a letter, I repent not, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same Epistle made you sorry, though it were but for a season.",
      "9": "I now rejoice, not that ye were sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye sorrowed godly, so that in nothing ye were hurt by us.",
      "10": "For godly sorrow causeth repentance unto salvation, not to be repented of: but the worldly sorrow causeth death.",
      "11": "For behold, this thing that ye have been godly sorry, what great care hath it wrought in you: yea, what clearing of yourselves: yea, what indignation: yea, what fear: yea, how great desire: yea, what a zeal: yea, what revenge: in all things ye have showed yourselves, that ye are pure in this matter.",
      "12": "Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did not it for his cause that had done the wrong, neither for his cause that had the injury, but that our care toward you in the sight of God might appear unto you.",
      "13": "Therefore we were comforted, because ye were comforted: but rather we rejoiced much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.",
      "14": "For if that I have boasted anything to him of you, I have not been ashamed: but as I have spoken unto you all things in truth, even so our boasting unto Titus was true.",
      "15": "And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, when he remembereth the obedience of you all, and how with fear and trembling ye received him.",

    "8": {
      "1": "We do you also to wit, brethren, of the grace of God bestowed upon the Churches of Macedonia.",

      "3": "For to their power (I bear record) yea, and beyond their power they were willing.",
      "4": "And prayed us with great instance that we would receive the grace, and fellowship of the ministering which is toward the Saints.",
      "5": "And this they did, not as we looked for: but gave their own selves, first to the Lord, and after unto us by the will of God,",
      "6": "That we should exhort Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also accomplish the same grace among you also.",
      "7": "Therefore, as ye abound in everything, in faith and word, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love towards us, even so see that ye abound in this grace also.",
      "8": "This say I not by commandment, but because of the diligence of others: therefore prove I the naturalness of your love.",
      "9": "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he being rich, for your sakes became poor, that ye through his poverty might be made rich.",
      "10": "And I show my mind herein: for this is expedient for you, which have begun not to do only, but also to will, a year ago.",
      "11": "Now therefore perform to do it also, that as there was a readiness to will, even so ye may perform it of that which ye have.",
      "12": "For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.",
      "13": "Neither is it that other men should be eased and you grieved: But upon like condition, at this time your abundance supplieth their lack:",
      "14": "That also their abundance may be for your lack, that there may be equality.",
      "15": "As it is written, He that gathered much, had nothing over, and he that gathered little, had not the less.",
      "16": "And thanks be unto God, which had put in the heart of Titus the same care for you.",
      "17": "Because he accepted the exhortation, yea, he was so careful that of his own accord he went unto you.",
      "18": "And we have sent also with him the brother, whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the Churches.",
      "19": "(And not so only, but is also chosen of the Churches to be a fellow in our journey, concerning this grace that is ministered by us unto the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your prompt mind.)",

      "22": "And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have ofttimes proved to be diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, for the great confidence, which I have in you.",
      "23": "Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my fellow and helper to you-ward: or of our brethren, they are messengers of the Churches, and the glory of Christ.",

      "3": "Now have I sent the brethren, lest our rejoicing over you should be in vain in this behalf, that ye (as I have said) be ready.",
      "4": "Lest if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we may not say, you) should be ashamed in this my constant boasting.",
      "5": "Wherefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to come before unto you, and to finish your benevolence appointed afore, that it might be ready, and come as of benevolence, and not as of niggardliness.",
      "6": "This yet remember, that he which soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly, and he that soweth liberally, shall reap also liberally.",
      "7": "As every man wisheth in his heart, so let him give, not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.",
      "8": "And God is able to make all grace to abound toward you, that ye always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound in every good work,",

      "10": "Also he that findeth seed to the sower, will minister likewise bread for food, and multiply your seed, and increase the fruits of your benevolence.)",
      "11": "That on all parts ye may be made rich unto all liberality, which causeth through us thanksgiving unto God.",
      "12": "For the ministration of this service not only supplieth the necessities of the Saints, but also abundantly causeth many to give thanks to God,",
      "13": "(Which by the experiment of this ministration praise God for your voluntary submission to the Gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men.)",

      "3": "Nevertheless, though we walk in the flesh, yet we do not war after the flesh.",

      "11": "Let such one think this, that such as we are in word by letters, when we are absent, such will we be also in deed, when we are present.",
      "12": "For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or to compare ourselves to them, which praise themselves: but they understand not that they measure themselves with themselves, and compare themselves with themselves.",
      "13": "But we will not rejoice of things, which are not within our measure, but according to the measure of the line, whereof God hath distributed unto us a measure to attain even unto you.",
