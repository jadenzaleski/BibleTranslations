      "1": "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.",
      "2": "This one was in the beginning with God.",
      "3": "All things came into being through him, and apart from him not one thing came into being that has come into being.",
      "4": "In him was life, and the life was the light of humanity.",
      "5": "And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.",
      "6": "A man came, sent from God, whose name was John.",
      "7": "This one came for a witness, in order that he could testify about the light, so that all would believe through him.",
      "8": "That one was not the light, but came in order that he could testify about the light.",
      "9": "The true light, who gives light to every person, was coming into the world.",
      "10": "He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, and the world did not recognize him.",
      "11": "He came to his own things, and his own people did not receive him.",
      "12": "But as many as received him—to those who believe in his name—he gave to them authority to become children of God,",
      "13": "who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a husband, but of God.",
      "14": "And the Word became flesh and took up residence among us, and we saw his glory, glory as of the one and only from the Father, full of grace and truth.",
      "15": "John testified about him and cried out, saying, “This one was he about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’”",
      "16": "For from his fullness we have all received, and grace after grace.",
      "17": "For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "No one has seen God at any time; the one and only, God, the one who is in the bosom of the Father—that one has made him known.",
      "19": "And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they could ask him, “Who are you?”",
      "20": "And he confessed—and he did not deny, and confessed—“I am not the Christ!”",
      "21": "And they asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not!” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No!”",
      "22": "Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”",
      "23": "He said,\n“I am ‘the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,\n    “Make straight the way of the Lord,”’\njust as Isaiah the prophet said.”",
      "24": "(And they had been sent from the Pharisees.)",
      "25": "And they asked him and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”",
      "26": "John answered them, saying, “I baptize with water. In your midst stands one whom you do not know—",
      "27": "the one who comes after me, of whom I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal!”",
      "28": "These things took place in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",
      "29": "On the next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!",
      "30": "This one is the one about whom I said, ‘After me is coming a man who is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’",
      "31": "And I did not know him, but in order that he could be revealed to Israel, because of this I came baptizing with water.”",
      "32": "And John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and remaining upon him.",
      "33": "And I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water, that one said to me, ‘The one upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him—this one is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’",
      "34": "And I have seen and testify that this one is the Chosen One of God.",
      "35": "On the next day again John was standing there, and two of his disciples,",
      "36": "and looking at Jesus as he was walking by, he said, “Look! The Lamb of God!”",
      "37": "And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.",
      "38": "And Jesus, turning around and seeing them following him, said to them, “What do you seek?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means when translated “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”",
      "39": "He said to them, “Come and you will see!” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day (it was about the tenth hour).",
      "40": "Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed him.",
      "41": "This one first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated “Christ”).",
      "42": "He brought him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, “You are Simon the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is interpreted “Peter”).",
      "43": "On the next day he wanted to depart for Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow me!”",
      "44": "(Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.)",
      "45": "Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets wrote about—Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth!”",
      "46": "And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see!”",
      "47": "Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, “Look! A true Israelite in whom is no deceit!”",
      "48": "Nathanael said to him, “From where do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”",
      "49": "Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the king of Israel!”",
      "50": "Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these!”",
      "51": "And he said to him, “Truly, truly I say to all of you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”"

      "1": "And on the third day, there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.",
      "2": "And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding.",
      "3": "And when the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine!”",
      "4": "And Jesus said to her, “What does your concern have to do with me, woman? My hour has not yet come.”",
      "5": "His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it!”",
      "6": "Now six stone water jars were set there, in accordance with the ceremonial cleansing of the Jews, each holding two or three measures.",
      "7": "Jesus said to them, “Fill the water jars with water.” And they filled them to the brim.",
      "8": "And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the head steward. So they took it.",
      "9": "Now when the head steward tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it was from—but the servants who had drawn the water knew—the head steward summoned the bridegroom",
      "10": "and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and whenever they are drunk, the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!”",
      "11": "This beginning of signs Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.",
      "12": "After this he went down to Capernaum, and his mother and brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there a few days.",
      "13": "And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "14": "And he found in the temple courts those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated.",
      "15": "And he made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts, both the sheep and the oxen, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.",
      "16": "And to the ones selling the doves he said, “Take these things away from here! Do not make my Father’s house a marketplace!”",
      "17": "His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”",
      "18": "So the Jews answered and said to him, “What sign do you show to us, because you are doing these things?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up!”",
      "20": "Then the Jews said, “This temple has been under construction forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?”",
      "21": "But he was speaking about the temple of his body.",
      "22": "So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken.",
      "23": "Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name because they saw his signs which he was doing.",
      "24": "But Jesus himself did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people,",
      "25": "and because he did not need anyone to testify about man, for he himself knew what was in man."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Now there was a man of the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.",
      "2": "This man came to him at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one is able to perform these signs that you are performing unless God were with him.”",
      "3": "Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.”",
      "4": "Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is an old man? He is not able to enter into his mother’s womb for the second time and be born, can he?”",
      "5": "Jesus answered, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born of water and spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.",
      "6": "What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘It is necessary for you to be born from above.’",
      "8": "The wind blows wherever it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”",
      "9": "Nicodemus answered and said to him, “How can these things be?”",
      "10": "Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these things?",
      "11": "Truly, truly I say to you, we speak what we know, and we testify about what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony!",
      "12": "If I tell you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?",
      "13": "And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man.",
      "14": "And just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, thus it is necessary that the Son of Man be lifted up,",
      "15": "so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.”",
      "16": "For in this way God loved the world, so that he gave his one and only Son, in order that everyone who believes in him will not perish, but will have eternal life.",
      "17": "For God did not send his Son into the world in order that he should judge the world, but in order that the world should be saved through him.",
      "18": "The one who believes in him is not judged, but the one who does not believe has already been judged, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.",
      "19": "And this is the judgment: that the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.",
      "20": "For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed.",
      "21": "But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, in order that his deeds may be revealed, that they are done in God.",
      "22": "After these things Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing.",
      "23": "Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and they were coming and were being baptized.",
      "24": "(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)",
      "25": "So a dispute occurred on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew concerning purification.",
      "26": "And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, about whom you testified—look, this one is baptizing, and all are coming to him!”",
      "27": "John answered and said, “A man can receive not one thing unless it is granted to him from heaven!",
      "28": "You yourselves testify about me that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am sent before that one.’",
      "29": "The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine is complete.",
      "30": "It is necessary for that one to increase, but for me to decrease.”",
      "31": "The one who comes from above is over all. The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth; the one who comes from heaven is over all.",
      "32": "What he has seen and heard, this he testifies, and no one accepts his testimony.",
      "33": "The one who accepts his testimony has attested that God is true.",
      "34": "For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit by measure.",
      "35": "The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.",
      "36": "The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life—but the wrath of God remains on him."

    "4": {
      "1": "Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John",
      "2": "(although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples),",
      "3": "he left Judea and departed again for Galilee.",
      "4": "And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.",
      "5": "Now he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.",
      "6": "And Jacob’s well was there, so Jesus, because he had become tired from the journey, simply sat down at the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
      "7": "A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me water to drink.”",
      "8": "(For his disciples had gone away into the town so that they could buy food.)",
      "9": "So the Samaritan woman said to him, “How do you, being a Jew, ask from me water to drink, since I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)",
      "10": "Jesus answered and said to her, “If you had known the gift of God and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me water to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”",
      "11": "The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket and the well is deep! From where then do you get this living water?",
      "12": "You are not greater than our father Jacob, are you, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his sons and his livestock?”",
      "13": "Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again.",
      "14": "But whoever drinks of this water which I will give to him will never be thirsty for eternity, but the water which I will give to him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”",
      "15": "The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or come here to draw water!”",
      "16": "He said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.”",
      "17": "The woman answered and said to him, “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have said rightly, ‘I do not have a husband,’",
      "18": "for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you have now is not your husband; this you have said truthfully!”",
      "19": "The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.",
      "20": "Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.”",
      "21": "Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.",
      "22": "You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.",
      "23": "But an hour is coming—and now is here—when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for indeed the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers.",
      "24": "God is spirit, and the ones who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”",
      "25": "The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (the one called Christ); “whenever that one comes, he will proclaim all things to us.”",
      "26": "Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.",
      "27": "And at this point his disciples came, and they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, “What do you seek?” or “Why are you speaking with her?”",
      "28": "So the woman left her water jar and went away into the town and said to the people,",
      "29": "“Come, see a man who told me everything I have ever done! Perhaps this one is the Christ?”",
      "30": "They went out from the town and were coming to him.",
      "31": "In the meanwhile the disciples were asking him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something!”",
      "32": "But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”",
      "33": "So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one brought him anything to eat, did they?”",
      "34": "Jesus said to them, “My food is that I do the will of the one who sent me and complete his work.",
      "35": "Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months and the harvest comes’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.",
      "36": "The one who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, in order that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together.",
      "37": "For in this instance the saying is true, ‘It is one who sows and another who reaps.’",
      "38": "I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have worked, and you have entered into their work.”",
      "39": "Now from that town many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me everything that I have done.”",
      "40": "So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them. And he stayed there two days.",
      "41": "And many more believed because of his word,",
      "42": "And they were saying to the woman, “No longer because of what you said do we believe, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is truly the Savior of the world!”",
      "43": "And after the two days he departed from there into Galilee.",
      "44": "For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland.",
      "45": "So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem at the feast (for they themselves had also come to the feast).",
      "46": "Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was at Capernaum a certain royal official whose son was sick.",
      "47": "This man, when he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, went to him and asked that he come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.",
      "48": "So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe!”",
      "49": "The royal official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!”",
      "50": "Jesus said to him, “Go, your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he departed.",
      "51": "Now as he was going down, his slaves met him, saying that his child was alive.",
      "52": "So he inquired from them the hour at which he had gotten better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”",
      "53": "So the father knew that it was that same hour at which Jesus said to him, “Your son will live,” and he himself believed, and his whole household.",
      "54": "Now this is again a second sign Jesus performed when he came from Judea into Galilee."

    "5": {
      "1": "After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool called in Aramaic Bethzatha, which has five porticoes.",
      "3": "In these were lying a large number of those who were sick, blind, lame, paralyzed.",
      "4": "",
      "5": "And a certain man was there who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness.",
      "6": "Jesus, when he saw this one lying there and knew that he had been sick a long time already, said to him, “Do you want to become well?”",
      "7": "The one who was sick answered him, “Sir, I do not have anyone that, whenever the water is stirred up, could put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another goes down before me.”",
      "8": "Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk!”",
      "9": "And immediately the man became well and picked up his mat and began to walk. (Now it was the Sabbath on that day.)",
      "10": "So the Jews were saying to the one who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not permitted for you to pick up the mat!”",
      "11": "But he answered them, “The one who made me well—that one said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk!’”",
      "12": "So they asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk?’”",
      "13": "But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn while a crowd was in the place.",
      "14": "After these things Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “Look, you have become well! Sin no longer, lest something worse happen to you.”",
      "15": "The man went and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the one who made him well.",
      "16": "And on account of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.",
      "17": "But he answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working.”",
      "18": "So on account of this the Jews were seeking even more to kill him, because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal with God.",
      "19": "So Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing from himself except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever that one does, these things also the Son does likewise.",
      "20": "For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing. And greater works than these he will show him, so that you will be astonished.",
      "21": "For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive, thus also the Son makes alive whomever he wishes.",
      "22": "For the Father does not judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son,",
      "23": "in order that all people will honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.",
      "24": "Truly, truly I say to you that the one who hears my word and who believes the one who sent me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.",
      "25": "“Truly, truly I say to you, that an hour is coming—and now is here—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones who hear will live.",
      "26": "For just as the Father has life in himself, thus also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself.",
      "27": "And he has granted him authority to carry out judgment, because he is the Son of Man.",
      "28": "“Do not be astonished at this, because an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear his voice",
      "29": "and they will come out—those who have done good things to a resurrection of life, but those who have practiced evil things to a resurrection of judgment.",
      "30": "I am able to do nothing from myself. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.",
      "31": "“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.",
      "32": "There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.",
      "33": "You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.",
      "34": "(And I do not receive testimony from people, but I say these things in order that you may be saved.)",
      "35": "That one was the lamp which was burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice for an hour in his light.",
      "36": "“But I have a testimony greater than John’s, for the works which the Father has given to me that I should complete them—the very works which I am doing—these testify about me, that the Father has sent me.",
      "37": "And the Father who sent me, that one has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form.",
      "38": "And you do not have his word residing in yourselves, because the one whom that one sent, in this one you do not believe.",
      "39": "You search the scriptures because you think that you have eternal life in them, and it is these that testify about me.",

      "43": "I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me. If another should come in his own name, you would accept that one!",
      "44": "How are you able to believe, if you accept glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is from the only God?",

      "2": "So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord from the tomb and we do not know where they have put him!”",
      "3": "Then Peter and the other disciple went out and were going to the tomb.",
      "4": "And the two were running together, and the other disciple ran ahead, faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first.",
      "5": "And bending over to look, he saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, though he did not go in.",
      "6": "Then Simon Peter also came following him, and he went into the tomb and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there,",
      "7": "and the facecloth that was on his head—not lying with the strips of linen cloth, but folded up separately in one place.",
      "8": "So then the other disciple who had come to the tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed.",
      "9": "(For they did not yet know the scripture that it was necessary for him to rise from the dead.)",
      "10": "Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.",
      "11": "But Mary stood outside at the tomb, weeping. Then, while she was weeping, she bent over to look into the tomb,",
      "12": "and she saw two angels in white, seated one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying.",
      "13": "And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him!”",
      "14": "When she had said these things, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and she did not know that it was Jesus.",
      "15": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” She thought that it was the gardener, and said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him.”",
      "16": "Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned around and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni” (which means “Teacher”).",
      "17": "Jesus said to her, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.’”",
      "18": "Mary Magdalene came and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and he had said these things to her.",
      "19": "Now when it was evening on that day—the first day of the week—and the doors had been shut where the disciples were because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, “Peace to you.”",
      "20": "And when he had said this, he showed his hands and his side to them. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.",

      "26": "And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Although the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said, “Peace to you.”",

      "29": "Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen me, have you believed? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.”",
      "30": "Now Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of the disciples which are not recorded in this book,",

      "3": "Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing!” They said to him, “We also are coming with you.” They went out and got into the boat, and during that night they caught nothing.",

      "5": "So Jesus said to them, “Children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you? They answered him, “No.”",
      "6": "And he said to them, “Throw the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they threw it, and were no longer able to haul it in from the large number of the fish.",
      "7": "Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” So Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, tied around himself his outer garment (for he was naked) and threw himself into the sea.",
      "8": "But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net of fish, because they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away.",
      "9": "So when they got out on the land, they saw a charcoal fire laid there, and a fish lying on it, and bread.",
      "10": "Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught.”",

      "12": "Jesus said to them, “Come, eat breakfast!” But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew that it was the Lord.",
      "13": "Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.",
      "14": "This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he had been raised from the dead.",
      "15": "Now when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs!”",
      "16": "He said to him again a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Shepherd my sheep!”",
      "17": "He said to him a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed because he said to him a third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything! You know that I love you!” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep!",
      "18": "Truly, truly I say to you, when you were young, you tied your clothes around yourself and walked wherever you wanted. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will tie you up and carry you where you do not want to go.",
      "19": "(Now he said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God.) And after he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me!”",
      "20": "Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them (who also leaned back on his chest at the dinner and said, “Lord, who is the one betraying you?”)",

      "22": "Jesus said to him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!”",
      "23": "So this saying went out to the brothers that that disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”",
      "24": "This is the disciple who is testifying about these things, and who has written down these things. And we know that his testimony is true.",
