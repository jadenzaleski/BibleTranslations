      "4": "and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause useless speculations rather than God’s plan that is by faith.",
      "5": "But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a faith without hypocrisy,",
      "6": "from which some have deviated, and have turned away into fruitless discussion,",
      "7": "wanting to be teachers of the law, although they do not understand either the things which they are saying or the things concerning which they are speaking confidently.",
      "8": "But we know that the law is good, if anyone makes use of it lawfully,",
      "9": "knowing this, that the law is not given for a righteous person but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and totally worldly, for the one who kills his father and the one who kills his mother, for murderers,",

      "12": "I give thanks to the one who strengthens me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he considered me faithful, placing me into ministry,",
      "13": "although I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, but I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief,",
      "14": "and the grace of our Lord abounded with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.",
      "15": "The saying is trustworthy and worthy of all acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.",
      "16": "But because of this I was shown mercy, in order that in me foremost, Christ Jesus might demonstrate his total patience, for an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life.",
      "17": "Now to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, to the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.",

      "11": "A woman must learn in quietness with all submission.",
      "12": "But I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.",
      "13": "For Adam was formed first, then Eve,",
      "14": "and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, because she was deceived, came into transgression.",

      "11": "The wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderous, temperate, faithful in all things.",
      "12": "Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.",

      "15": "But if I am delayed, I am writing in order that you may know how one must conduct oneself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and mainstay of the truth.",
      "16": "And most certainly, great is the mystery of godliness:\nWho was revealed in the flesh,\n    was vindicated by the Spirit,\nwas seen by angels,\n    was proclaimed among the Gentiles,\nwas believed on in the world,\n    was taken up in glory."

      "3": "who forbid marrying and insist on abstaining from foods that God created for sharing in with thankfulness by those who believe and who know the truth,",
      "4": "because everything created by God is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thankfulness,",
      "5": "for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.",
      "6": "By teaching these things to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, trained in the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed faithfully.",
      "7": "But reject those worthless myths told by elderly women, and train yourself for godliness.",
      "8": "For the training of the body is somewhat profitable, but godliness is profitable for everything, because it holds promise for the present life and for the life to come.",
      "9": "The statement is trustworthy and deserving of complete acceptance.",
      "10": "For to this end we labor and suffer reproach, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of believers.",

      "4": "But if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must learn to show profound respect for their own household first, and to pay back recompense to their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.",
      "5": "But the widow who is one truly, and is left alone, has put her hope in God and continues in her petitions and prayers night and day.",
      "6": "But the one who lives for sensual pleasure is dead even though she lives.",
      "7": "And command these things, in order that they may be irreproachable.",

      "14": "Therefore I want younger widows to marry, to bear children, to manage a household, to give the adversary no opportunity for reproach.",
      "15": "For already some have turned away and followed after Satan.",
      "16": "If any believing woman has widows, she must help them, and the church must not be burdened, in order that it may help those who are truly widows.",
      "17": "The elders who lead well must be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor by speaking and teaching.",
      "18": "For the scripture says, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is threshing,” and “The worker is worthy of his wages.”",

      "3": "If anyone teaches other doctrine and does not devote himself to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness,",
      "4": "he is conceited, understanding nothing, but having a morbid interest concerning controversies and disputes about words, from which come envy, strife, slanders, evil suspicions,",
      "5": "constant wrangling by people of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who consider godliness to be a means of gain.",
      "6": "But godliness with contentment is a great means of gain.",
      "7": "For we have brought nothing into the world, so that neither can we bring anything out.",
      "8": "But if we have food and clothing, with these things we will be content.",
      "9": "But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and a trap and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge those people into ruin and destruction.",
      "10": "For the love of money is a root of all evil, by which some, because they desire it, have gone astray from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains.",
      "11": "But you, O man of God, flee from these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patient endurance, gentleness.",
