    "1": {
      "1": "There was a certain man from Ramathaim Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.",
      "2": "He had two wives; the name of the first was Hannah, and the name of the second was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.",
      "3": "Now this man used to go up from his town year by year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of hosts in Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to Yahweh.",
      "4": "On the day Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.",
      "5": "But to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, though Yahweh had closed her womb.",
      "6": "(Now her rival wife would provoke her severely in order to upset her because Yahweh had closed her womb.)",
      "7": "And so he used to do year after year; whenever she went up to the house of Yahweh, she would provoke her so that she would weep and would not eat.",
      "8": "So Elkanah her husband would say to her: “Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat? And why are you heartsick? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "Then Hannah got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh. (Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the temple of Yahweh.)",
      "10": "She was deeply troubled, so she prayed to Yahweh and wept bitterly.",
      "11": "She made a vow and said: “O Yahweh of hosts, if you will look with compassion on the misery of your female servant, and will remember me, and not forget your female servant, and will give to your female servant a male child then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and a razor will never pass over his head.”",
      "12": "While she continued to pray before Yahweh, Eli was observing her mouth.",
      "13": "Now Hannah had been speaking in her heart; her lips were moving, but her voice could not be heard, so Eli considered her to be drunk.",
      "14": "Then Eli said to her, “How long will you behave like someone who is drunk? Put away your wine!”",
      "15": "But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord. I am a woman deeply distressed, but I have not drunk wine or strong drink. Rather, I have poured out my soul before Yahweh.",
      "16": "Do not regard your female servant as worthless, but because of the extent of my worries and my provocation I have spoken all of this.”",
      "17": "Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have asked of him.”",
      "18": "And she said, “May your female slave find favor in your sight.” Then the woman went on her way and ate something, and her face did not look sad any longer.",
      "19": "Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before Yahweh and returned to their house at Ramah. Then Elkanah had sexual relations with Hannah his wife, and Yahweh remembered her.",
      "20": "In due time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She called his name Samuel, for she said, “I requested him from Yahweh.”",
      "21": "So the man Elkanah went up with all his household to make the annual sacrifice to Yahweh and to pay his vow.",
      "22": "But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “Once the boy is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear before Yahweh; and he will remain there forever.”",
      "23": "So her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what seems right to you; stay until you wean him. Only may Yahweh fulfill his word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.",
      "24": "Then she brought him up with her when she had weaned him, along with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of Yahweh at Shiloh while the boy was still young.",
      "25": "They slaughtered the bull, and they brought the boy to Eli.",
      "26": "She said, “Excuse me, my lord. As you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood with you in this place to pray to Yahweh.",
      "27": "I prayed for this boy, and Yahweh has given me my request that I asked from him.",
      "28": "I in turn have lent him to Yahweh. As long as he lives he is lent to Yahweh.” Then they worshiped Yahweh there."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Then Hannah prayed and said,\n“My heart exults in Yahweh, my strength is exalted in Yahweh; I grin over my enemies, for I rejoice over your salvation.",
      "2": "There is no one holy like Yahweh, for there is no one besides you,\n    and there is no rock like our God.",
      "3": "Do not increase speaking very proud words!\n    Let no arrogance go forth from your mouth,\n    for Yahweh is a God of knowledge\n    whose deeds are not weighed.",
      "4": "The bows of mighty warriors are shattered,\n    but those who stumble gird themselves with strength.",
      "5": "Those who were full must hire themselves out for bread,\n    but those who are hungry will become fat.\nAs for the infertile, she will bear seven,\n    but she who has many sons withers away.",
      "6": "Yahweh kills and restores alive,\n    he brings down to Sheol and raises up.",
      "7": "Yahweh makes poor and makes rich;\n    he brings low and also exalts.",
      "8": "He raises up the poor from the dust.\n    From the ash heap he lifts up the needy,\nto cause them to sit with noble people\n    and to cause them to inherit a seat of honor.\nFor the pillars of the earth belong to Yahweh\n    and he has set the inhabited world on them.",
      "9": "He will guard the feet of his faithful ones,\n    but the wicked will be destroyed in the darkness,\n    because a man will not prevail by his might.",
      "10": "Yahweh will shatter his adversaries;\n    he will thunder against them in the heavens.\n    Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth.\nHe will give strength to his king\n    and will exalt the might of his anointed one.",
      "11": "Then Elkanah went to Ramah, to his house. Now the boy was serving Yahweh in the presence of Eli the priest.",
      "12": "Now the sons of Eli were worthless scoundrels; they did not know Yahweh.",
      "13": "And the custom of the priests with the people was this: When any man brought a sacrifice, as the meat was boiling, the servant of the priest would take a three-pronged meat fork in his hand",
      "14": "and would thrust it into the pan or into the kettle or into the cauldron or into the cooking pot. All that the meat fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they used to do to all of the Israelites who came there at Shiloh.",
      "15": "Also, before they offered up the fat as a burnt offering, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest meat for roasting, for he will not take boiled meat from you, but only raw.”",
      "16": "And if the man said to him, “Let them burn the fat completely first, then take for yourself as you desire,” then he would say to him, “No! Give it now! If not, I will take it by force!”",
      "17": "So the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of Yahweh, because the men treated the offering of Yahweh with contempt.",
      "18": "Now Samuel was serving before Yahweh, as a boy wearing a linen ephod.",
      "19": "His mother used to make for him a small robe and take it to him year by year whenever she came up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.",
      "20": "And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and he said, “May Yahweh give you an offspring from this woman in place of the petitioned one that she requested from Yahweh.” Then they went to their home.",
      "21": "Yahweh took note of Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters, while the young man Samuel grew up with Yahweh.",
      "22": "Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel and that they were having sexual relations with the women who were serving at the entrance of the tent of assembly.",
      "23": "And he asked them, “Why are you doing all these things that I am hearing, namely, your evil dealings with all these people?",
      "24": "No, my sons, the report is not good that I am hearing the people of Yahweh spreading.",
      "25": "If a man sins against a man, then God can intercede for him. But if a man sins against Yahweh, who can intercede for him?” But they did not obey their father, because Yahweh wanted to kill them.",
      "26": "But the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with Yahweh and with the people.",
      "27": "Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him: “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Did I not clearly reveal myself to the house of your ancestor when they were in Egypt under the house of Pharaoh?",
      "28": "And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be a priest to me, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to bear an ephod before me. I gave to the house of your ancestor all the offerings made by fire by the Israelites.",
      "29": "Why do you despise my sacrifice and my offering which I commanded for my dwelling place, while you honored your sons more than me by making yourselves fat from the best of all the offerings of my people Israel?",
      "30": "Therefore,’ declares Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘though I solemnly said that your house and the house of your ancestor would walk before me forever, but now,’ declares Yahweh, ‘far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me, I will treat with contempt!",
      "31": "Look, days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of the house of your ancestor so that no one in your house will live to old age.",
      "32": "You will look at the distress of my dwelling place, despite all the good caused for Israel, but there will never be an old man in your household forever!",
      "33": "The only one I will not cut off from my altar is you. Rather, to cause your eyes to fail and to cause your soul to grieve, all the members of your household will die as men.",
      "34": "This is the sign for you that will come regarding your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: they will both die on the same day!",
      "35": "But I will raise up for myself a reliable priest; he will do just according to what is in my heart and in my soul. I will build for him a lasting house and he will walk continually before my anointed one forever.",
      "36": "All the remainder of your household will come to bow down before him for a bit of silver or a loaf of bread and will say, “Please assign me to one of the priestly offices so that I can eat a morsel of bread.”’”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Now the boy Samuel was serving Yahweh in the presence of Eli. The word of Yahweh was rare in those days; visions were not widespread.",
      "2": "And then one day when Eli was lying in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow weak so that he was not able to see)",
      "3": "and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, Samuel was lying in the temple of Yahweh where the ark of God was.",
      "4": "Then Yahweh called out to Samuel and he said, “Here I am!”",
      "5": "And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” But he said, “I did not call you. Go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.",
      "6": "And Yahweh called Samuel again, so Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” And he said, “I did not call you, my son. Go back and lie down.”",
      "7": "Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh, and the word of Yahweh had not yet been revealed to him.",
      "8": "Again Yahweh called Samuel a third time, so he got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” Then Eli realized that Yahweh was calling the boy.",
      "9": "So Eli said to Samuel “Go lie down. If he calls to you, then you must say, ‘Speak Yahweh, because your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.",
      "10": "Then Yahweh came and stood there and called out as before, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, because your servant is listening.”",
      "11": "So Yahweh said to Samuel, “Look, I am doing something in Israel which will cause the two ears of everyone who hears it to tingle.",
      "12": "On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken against his household, from beginning to end.",
      "13": "I will make him know that I am about to judge his household forever because of the iniquity that he knew, for his sons were bringing curses on themselves, but he did not rebuke them.",
      "14": "Therefore I swore to the house of Eli that the iniquity of the house of Eli would not be atoned for by sacrifice or by offering forever.”",
      "15": "So Samuel lay down until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of Yahweh, but Samuel was afraid of telling the vision to Eli.",
      "16": "Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” And he said, “Here I am.”",
      "17": "And he said, “What is the message that he spoke to you? Please do not conceal it from me. May God punish you severely if you conceal anything from me of all the words that he told you.”",
      "18": "So Samuel told him all the words and did not conceal anything from him. And he said, “He is Yahweh, he will do what is good in his sight.”",
      "19": "And Samuel grew up, and Yahweh was with him. He did not allow any of his prophecies to go unfulfilled.",
      "20": "All Israel from Dan to Beersheba realized that Samuel was faithful as a prophet to Yahweh.",
      "21": "And Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh, for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of Yahweh."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines for battle, and they encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.",
      "2": "The Philistines lined up for the battle to meet Israel, and the battle was prolonged until Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield.",
      "3": "When the army came back to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to us from Shiloh so that it may come into our midst and deliver us from the hand of our enemies.”",
      "4": "So the army sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of hosts who sits between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.",
      "5": "Now when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh arrived at the camp, all Israel let out a loud shout so that the earth shook.",
      "6": "When the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What is the noise of this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?” Then they learned that the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp.",
      "7": "So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come to the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us, for this has never happened before!",
      "8": "Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the same gods who struck the Egyptians with all sorts of plagues in the desert.",
      "9": "Take courage and be men, you Philistines, lest you end up serving the Hebrews just like they have served you. Be men and fight!”",
      "10": "So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated and each man fled to his tent, for the slaughter was very great. Thirty thousand foot soldiers from Israel fell.",
      "11": "Furthermore, the ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.",
      "12": "A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh that same day, and his clothes were torn and earth was on his head.",
      "13": "When he came, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road watching, because his heart was anxious about the ark of God. Now the man had come to give his report in the city, and all the city cried out.",
      "14": "When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What is the noise of this commotion?” Then the man came quickly and told Eli.",
      "15": "Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes stayed fixed ahead and he was not able to see.",
      "16": "And the man said to Eli, “I am the one who has come from the battle line! I have fled today from the battle line!” And he said, “What exactly happened, my son?”",
      "17": "Then the messenger answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines. There has been a great defeat among the troops. Also, your two sons have died, Hophni and Phinehas, and the ark of God has been captured.”",
      "18": "Just as he mentioned the ark of God, he fell from his chair backwards against the side of the gate. He broke his neck and died, because the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.",
      "19": "Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the news concerning the capture of the ark of God and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she went into labor and gave birth, because her labor pains came upon her.",
      "20": "Just before the time of her death, those attending her said, “Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer, or pay any attention.",
      "21": "She called the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” referring to the capture of the ark of God and concerning her father-in-law and husband.",
      "22": "And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God was captured.”"

    "5": {
      "1": "Now the Philistines had captured the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.",
      "2": "Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon.",
      "3": "When the Ashdodites got up early the next morning, there was Dagon fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh! So they took Dagon and returned him to his place.",
      "4": "When they got up early in the morning the next day, there was Dagon fallen again with his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh! The head of Dagon and the palms of his two hands were cut off, lying at the threshold; only the body of Dagon was left.",
      "5": "(Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who come into the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod until this very day.)",
      "6": "Now the hand of Yahweh was heavy against the Ashdodites and he destroyed them and struck them with tumors, both in Ashdod and its territories.",
      "7": "The men of Ashdod saw that it was so, and they said, “The ark of the God of Israel should not remain with us, because his hand is harsh on us and on Dagon our god!”",
      "8": "So they sent and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines to them, and they asked, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” And they said, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around toward Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel to Gath.",
      "9": "After they moved it, the hand of Yahweh was against the city, causing a very great confusion, and he struck the men of the city from the youngest to the oldest, causing tumors to break out on them.",
      "10": "So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people!”",
      "11": "So they sent and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines, and they said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it return to its place, so that it will not kill us and our people.” For a deadly confusion was throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.",
      "12": "The men who did not die were struck with the tumors, so that the cry of the city for help went up to heaven."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Now the ark of Yahweh had been in the territory of the Philistines for seven months,",
      "2": "and the Philistines called to the priests and to those who practiced divination, saying, “What should we do with the ark of Yahweh? Inform us how we should send it to its place.”",
      "3": "They said, “If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel away, you must not send it away empty, but by all means return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will become known to you why his hand is not turned aside from you.”",
      "4": "And they said, “What is the guilt offering that we should return to him?” They said, “The number of the rulers of the Philistines is five. Therefore send five gold tumors and five gold mice, because one plague was on all of you and all your rulers.",
      "5": "You must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that are ravaging the land, and you must give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand on you and on your gods and on your land.",
      "6": "Why should you harden your hearts like the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? Is it not just like when he dealt with them wantonly so that they sent them away and they left?",
      "7": "So then, prepare one new utility cart and two milking cows that have never had a yoke on them, and you must harness the cows to the utility cart and then turn their calves from following them to their stall.",
      "8": "And you must take the ark of Yahweh and place it on the utility cart with the gold objects that you are returning to him as a guilt offering. You must place them in the container beside the ark and then send it off so that it goes away.",
      "9": "You must watch; if it goes up by the way of its territory to Beth Shemesh, he has caused this great disaster to come on us. But if not, then we will know his hand has not struck us; it was by chance that this happened to us.",
      "10": "So the men did so; they took two milking cows and harnessed them to the utility cart, but they shut up their calves in the stall.",
      "11": "Then they put the ark of Yahweh on the utility cart with the container holding the gold mice and the images of their tumors.",
      "12": "The cows went straight on the way on the road to Beth Shemesh, on the one main road, lowing as they went. They did not turn aside to the right or to the left, and the rulers of the Philistines were walking after them up to the border of Beth Shemesh.",
      "13": "Now the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley. They lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and they were glad to see it.",
      "14": "The utility cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stopped there where there was a large stone. They split the wood of the utility cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to Yahweh.",
      "15": "Then the Levites took down the ark of Yahweh and the container that was beside it, in which were the gold objects, and they set them on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings, and they made sacrifices to Yahweh on that day.",
      "16": "The five rulers of the Philistines saw it and returned to Ekron that same day.",
      "17": "Now these are the gold tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to Yahweh: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron.",
      "18": "And the gold mice according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines, for their five rulers, from the fortified city to the unwalled village of the open country as far as the great stone, where they set the ark of Yahweh until this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.",
      "19": "He struck seventy men among the men of Beth Shemesh because they looked into the ark of Yahweh. So the people mourned because Yahweh had struck a great blow among the people.",
      "20": "Then the men of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? And to whom shall it go up from us?”",
      "21": "So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of Yahweh. Come down and take it up to yourselves.”"
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "The men of Kiriath Jearim came and brought up the ark of Yahweh, and they brought it to the house of Abinadab in Gibeah. They consecrated Eleazer his son to guard the ark of Yahweh.",
      "2": "From the day the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, days multiplied and became twenty years while all the house of Israel mourned after Yahweh.",
      "3": "And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If with all your heart you are turning to Yahweh, remove the foreign gods and Ashtoreths from your midst. Commit your hearts to Yahweh and serve him alone. Then he will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”",
      "4": "So the Israelites removed the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and they served Yahweh alone.",
      "5": "Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to Yahweh for you.”",
      "6": "So they gathered to Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before Yahweh. They fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against Yahweh!” So Samuel judged the Israelites at Mizpah.",
      "7": "Now when the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines.",
      "8": "Then the Israelites said to Samuel, “You must not cease from crying out to Yahweh our God, so that he will deliver us from the hand of the Philistines.”",
      "9": "So Samuel took a single nursing lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. Then Samuel cried out to Yahweh on behalf of Israel, and Yahweh answered him.",
      "10": "While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near for the battle against Israel. But Yahweh thundered against the Philistines with a great noise on that day and threw them into confusion so that they were defeated before Israel.",
      "11": "Then the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and they struck them down as far as below Beth Car.",
      "12": "So Samuel took a single stone and put it between Mizpah and Shen, and he named it Ebenezer and said, “Up to here Yahweh has helped us.”",
      "13": "So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come into the territory of Israel again, and the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.",
      "14": "The towns which the Philistines had taken from Israel were returned to Israel from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territories from the hand of the Philistines. Then there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.",
      "15": "Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.",
      "16": "He used to go on the circuit from year to year. He went around Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places.",
      "17": "Then he returned to Ramah, because his house was there, and there he judged Israel, and he built an altar to Yahweh there."

      "1": "When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.",
      "2": "The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.",
      "3": "But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after gain, they took bribes, and they perverted justice.",
      "4": "So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.",
      "5": "They said to him, “Look, you are old and your sons do not follow in your ways. So then appoint a king for us to judge us, like all the nations.",
      "6": "But the matter was displeasing to Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us,” so Samuel prayed to Yahweh.",
      "7": "Then Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people concerning all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.",
      "8": "Like all the deeds they have done from the day I brought them up from Egypt until this day, they have forsaken me and have served other gods—so they are doing to you also.",
      "9": "And so then, listen to their voice. However, you must earnestly warn them; you must explain to them the custom of the king who will rule over them.”",
      "10": "So Samuel spoke all the words of Yahweh to the people who were requesting a king from him.",

      "25": "Please do not let my lord set his heart against this worthless man, Nabal; for as his name, so is he. Nabal is his name, and stupidity is with him! But I, your female servant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.",
      "26": "So then, my lord, as Yahweh lives and as your soul lives, since Yahweh restrained you from bloodguilt by taking matters into your own hand, so then, may your enemies be like Nabal, even those who seek to do my lord harm.",

      "6": "David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah the brother of Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul, in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”",

      "11": "Yahweh forbid me from stretching out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed one! So then, please take the spear that is near his head and the jar of water, and let us go.”",

      "16": "This thing that you have done is not good. As Yahweh lives, surely you people deserve to die since you have not kept watch over your lord, over Yahweh’s anointed one! So then, see where the king’s spear is and the jar of water that was near his head!”",
      "17": "Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king.”",

      "20": "And so then, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of Yahweh, for the king of Israel has gone out to seek a single flea, as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”",

For the Philistines are about to make war against me, but God has turned away from me, and he does not answer me any more, not by the prophets or by the dreams. So I called to you to let me know what I should do.”",
