      "1": "Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,",
      "2": "to the church of God sanctified in Christ Jesus that is in Corinth, called to be saints, together with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their Lord and ours.",
      "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I give thanks to my God always concerning you, because of the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,",
      "5": "that in everything you were made rich in him, in all speech and all knowledge,",
      "6": "just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed in you,",
      "7": "so that you do not lack in any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
      "8": "who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "9": "God is faithful, by whom you were called to fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "10": "Now I exhort you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all say the same thing and there not be divisions among you, and that you be made complete in the same mind and with the same purpose.",
      "11": "For it has been made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by Chloe’s people, that there are quarrels among you.",
      "12": "But I say this, that each of you is saying, “I am with Paul,” and “I am with Apollos,” and “I am with Cephas,” and “I am with Christ.”",
      "13": "Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?",
      "14": "I give thanks that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,",
      "15": "lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name.",
      "16": "(Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Beyond that I do not know if I baptized anyone else.)",
      "17": "For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel, not with clever speech, lest the cross of Christ be emptied.",
      "18": "For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.",
      "19": "For it is written,\n“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,\n    and the intelligence of the intelligent I will confound.”",
      "20": "Where is the wise person? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?",
      "21": "For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.",
      "22": "For indeed, Jews ask for sign miracles and Greeks seek wisdom,",
      "23": "but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a cause for stumbling, but to the Gentiles foolishness,",
      "24": "but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
      "25": "For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.",
      "26": "For consider your calling, brothers, that not many were wise according to human standards, not many were powerful, not many were well born.",
      "27": "But the foolish things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the wise, and the weak things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the strong,",
      "28": "and the insignificant of the world, and the despised, God chose, the things that are not, in order that he might abolish the things that are,",
      "29": "so that all flesh may not boast before God.",
      "30": "But from him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,",
      "31": "so that, just as it is written, “The one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”"

    "2": {
      "1": "And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.",
      "2": "For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.",
      "3": "And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling,",
      "4": "and my speech and my preaching were not with the persuasiveness of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and power,",
      "5": "in order that your faith would not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.",
      "6": "Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but wisdom not of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are perishing,",
      "7": "but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God predestined before the ages for our glory,",
      "8": "which none of the rulers of this age knew. For if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.",
      "9": "But just as it is written,\n“Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,\n    and have not entered into the heart of man,\nall that God has prepared for those who love him.”",
      "10": "For to us God has revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.",
      "11": "For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man that is in him? Thus also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.",
      "12": "Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, in order that we may know the things freely given to us by God,",
      "13": "things which we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.",
      "14": "But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.",
      "15": "Now the spiritual person discerns all things, but he himself is judged by no one.",
      "16": "“For who has known the mind of the Lord; who has advised him?” But we have the mind of Christ."

    "3": {
      "1": "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to fleshly people, as to infants in Christ.",
      "2": "I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to eat it. But now you are still not able,",
      "3": "for you are still fleshly. For where there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and do you not live like unregenerate people?",
      "4": "For whenever anyone says, “I am with Paul,” and another, “I am with Apollos,” are you not merely human?",
      "5": "Therefore, what is Apollos and what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave.",
      "6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing it to grow.",
      "7": "So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who is causing it to grow.",
      "8": "Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, but each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
      "9": "For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.",
      "10": "According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building upon it. But each one must direct his attention to how he is building upon it.",
      "11": "For no one is able to lay another foundation than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
      "12": "Now if anyone builds upon the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,",
      "13": "the work of each one will become evident. For the day will reveal it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the work of each one, of what sort it is.",
      "14": "If anyone’s work that he has built upon it remains, he will receive a reward.",
      "15": "If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but so as through fire.",
      "16": "Do you not know that you are God’s temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you?",
      "17": "If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy this one. For God’s temple is holy, which you are.",
      "18": "Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks himself to be wise among you in this age, let him become a fool, in order that he may become wise.",
      "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it is written, “The one who catches the wise in their craftiness,”",
      "20": "and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”",
      "21": "So then, let no one boast in people. For all things are yours,",
      "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all things are yours,",
      "23": "and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s."

      "1": "Thus let a person consider us as servants of Christ and stewards of God’s mysteries.",
      "2": "In this case, moreover, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful.",
      "3": "But to me it is a very little matter that I be judged by you or by a human court, but I do not even judge myself.",
      "4": "For I am conscious of nothing against myself, but not by this am I vindicated. But the one who judges me is the Lord.",
      "5": "Therefore do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord should come, who will both enlighten the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the counsels of hearts, and then praise will come to each one from God.",
      "6": "Now I have applied these things, brothers, to myself and Apollos for your sake, in order that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, lest someone be inflated with pride on behalf of one person against the other.",
      "7": "For who concedes you superiority? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if indeed you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?",
      "8": "Already you are satiated! Already you are rich! Apart from us you reign as kings! And would that indeed you reigned as kings, in order that we also might reign as kings with you!",
      "9": "For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to people.",
      "10": "We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, but we are dishonored!",
      "11": "Until the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and roughly treated and homeless,",
      "12": "and we toil, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;",
      "13": "when we are slandered, we encourage. We have become like the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things, until now.",
      "14": "I am not writing these things to shame you, but admonishing you as my dear children.",
      "15": "For if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I fathered you through the gospel.",
      "16": "Therefore I exhort you, become imitators of me.",
      "17": "Because of this, I have sent to you Timothy, who is my dear and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church.",
      "18": "But some have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.",
      "19": "But I am coming to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the talk of the ones who have become arrogant, but the power.",
      "20": "For the kingdom of God is not with talk, but with power.",
      "21": "What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?"

      "1": "It is reported everywhere that there is sexual immorality among you, and sexual immorality of such a kind which does not even exist among the Gentiles, so that someone has the wife of his father.",
      "2": "And you are inflated with pride, and should you not rather have mourned, so that the one who has done this deed would be removed from your midst?",
      "3": "For although I am absent in body but present in spirit, I have already passed judgment on the one who has done this in this way, as if I were present.",
      "4": "In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and my spirit, together with the power of our Lord Jesus,",
      "5": "I have decided to hand over such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, in order that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.",
      "6": "Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough?",
      "7": "Clean out the old leaven in order that you may be a new batch of dough, just as you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.",
      "8": "So then, let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven or with the leaven of wickedness and sinfulness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
      "9": "I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.",
      "10": "By no means did I mean the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people and swindlers or idolaters, since then you would have to depart out of the world.",
      "11": "But now I have written to you not to associate with any so-called brother, if he is a sexually immoral person or a greedy person or an idolater or an abusive person or a drunkard or a swindler—with such a person not even to eat.",
      "12": "For what is it to me to judge those outside? Should you not judge those inside?",
      "13": "But those outside God will judge. Remove the evil person from among yourselves."

      "3": "Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention ordinary matters?",
      "4": "Therefore, if you have courts with regard to ordinary matters, do you seat these despised people in the church?",
      "5": "I say this to your shame. So is there not anyone wise among you who will be able to render a decision between his brothers?",
      "6": "But brother goes to court with brother, and this before unbelievers!",
      "7": "Therefore it is already completely a loss for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?",
      "8": "But you wrong and defraud, and do this to brothers!",
      "9": "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Neither sexually immoral people, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor passive homosexual partners, nor dominant homosexual partners,",
      "10": "nor thieves, nor greedy persons, not drunkards, not abusive persons, not swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.",

      "13": "Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food, but God will abolish both of them. Now the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.",
      "14": "And God both raised up the Lord and will raise us up by his power.",
      "15": "Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Therefore, shall I take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!",
      "16": "Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For it says, “The two will become one flesh.”",
      "17": "But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with him.",
      "18": "Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the one who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.",
      "19": "Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?",
      "20": "For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God with your body."

    "7": {
      "1": "Now concerning the things about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.”",
      "2": "But because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband.",
      "3": "The husband must fulfill his obligation to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.",
      "4": "The wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife does.",
      "5": "Do not defraud one another, except perhaps by agreement, for a time, in order that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then you should be together again, lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self control.",
      "6": "But I say this as a concession, not as a command.",
      "7": "I wish all people could be like myself, but each one has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that way.",
      "8": "Now I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain as I am.",
      "9": "But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire.",
      "10": "To the married I command—not I, but the Lord—a wife must not separate from her husband.",
      "11": "But if indeed she does separate, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.",
      "12": "Now to the rest I say—not the Lord—if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.",
      "13": "And if any wife has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce her husband.",
      "14": "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother, since otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.",
      "15": "But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. The brother or the sister is not bound in such cases. But God has called us in peace.",
      "16": "For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?",
      "17": "But to each one as the Lord has apportioned. As God has called each one, thus let him live—and thus I order in all the churches.",
      "18": "Was anyone called after being circumcised? He must not undo his circumcision. Was anyone called in uncircumcision? He must not become circumcised.",
      "19": "Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.",
      "20": "Each one in the calling in which he was called—in this he should remain.",
      "21": "Were you called while a slave? Do not let it be a concern to you. But if indeed you are able to become free, rather make use of it.",
      "22": "For the one who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord’s freedperson. Likewise the one who is called while free is a slave of Christ.",
      "23": "You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.",
      "24": "Each one in the situation in which he was called, brothers—in this he should remain with God.",
      "25": "Now concerning virgins I do not have a command from the Lord, but I am giving an opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy.",
      "26": "Therefore, I consider this to be good because of the impending distress, that it is good for a man to be thus.",
      "27": "Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek release. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.",
      "28": "But if you marry, you have not sinned, and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such people will have affliction in the flesh, and I would spare you.",
      "29": "But I say this, brothers: the time is shortened, that from now on even those who have wives should be as if they do not have wives,",
      "30": "and those who weep as if they do not weep, and those who rejoice as if they do not rejoice, and those who buy as if they do not possess,",
      "31": "and those who make use of the world as if they do not make full use of it. For the present form of this world is passing away.",
      "32": "But I want you to be free from care. The unmarried person cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.",
      "33": "But the one who is married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,",
      "34": "and he is divided. And the unmarried woman or the virgin cares for the things of the Lord, in order that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the married woman cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.",
      "35": "Now I am saying this for your own benefit, not that I may put a restriction on you, but to promote appropriate and devoted service to the Lord without distraction.",
      "36": "But if anyone thinks he is behaving dishonorably concerning his virgin, if she is past her prime and it ought to be thus, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin. Let them marry.",
      "37": "But he who stands firm in his heart, not having necessity, but has authority concerning his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin, he will do well.",
      "38": "So then, the one who marries his own virgin does well, and the one who does not marry her will do better.",
      "39": "A wife is bound for as long a time as her husband lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she wishes, only in the Lord.",

      "3": "But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him.",
      "4": "Therefore, concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that “an idol is nothing in the world” and that “there is no God except one.”",

      "7": "But this knowledge is not in everyone. But some, being accustomed until now to the idol, eat this food as food sacrificed to idols, and their conscience, because it is weak, is defiled.",
      "8": "But food does not bring us close to God. For neither if we eat do we have more, nor if we do not eat do we lack.",
      "9": "But watch out lest somehow this right of yours becomes a cause for stumbling to the weak.",
      "10": "For if someone should see you who has knowledge reclining for a meal in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, because it is weak, be strengthened so that he eats the food sacrificed to idols?",
      "11": "For the one who is weak—the brother for whom Christ died—is destroyed by your knowledge.",
      "12": "Now if you sin in this way against the brothers and wound their conscience, which is weak, you sin against Christ.",

      "15": "But I have not made use of any of these rights. And I am not writing these things in order that it may be thus with me. For it would be better to me rather to die than for anyone to deprive me of my reason for boasting.",
      "16": "For if I proclaim the gospel, it is not to me a reason for boasting, for necessity is imposed on me. For woe is to me if I do not proclaim the gospel.",
      "17": "For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward, but if I do so unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.",
      "18": "What then is my reward? That when I proclaim the gospel, I may offer the gospel free of charge, in order not to make full use of my right in the gospel.",
