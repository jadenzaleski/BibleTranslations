      "1": "After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Who will go up first for us against the Canaanites to fight against them?”",
      "2": "And Yahweh said, “Judah will go up. I hereby give the land into his hand.”",
      "3": "And Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Go up with me into my allotment, and let us fight against the Canaanites; then I too will go with you into your allotment.” And Simeon went with him.",
      "4": "And Judah went up, and Yahweh gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek.",

      "6": "And Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued after him; they caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.",
      "7": "Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table; just as I have done, so God has repaid to me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.",
      "8": "The descendants of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and they captured it, put it to the sword, and set the city on fire.",
      "9": "Afterward the descendants of Judah pursued to fight against the Canaanites who were living in the hill country, the Negev, and the Shephelah.",
      "10": "And Judah went against the Canaanites living in Hebron (the former name of Hebron was Kiriath Arba). And they defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.",

      "15": "And she said to him, “Give me a gift; you have given me the land of the Negev, and give me also a spring of water.” And Caleb gave to her the upper and lower spring.",
      "16": "The descendants of Hobab the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up with the descendants of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the Negev near Arad. And they went and settled with the people.",

      "20": "They gave Hebron to Caleb just as Moses said, and he drove out the three sons of Anak from there.",
      "21": "But the descendants of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived among the descendants of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.",
      "22": "Likewise, the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and Yahweh was with them.",
      "23": "And the house of Joseph spied out Bethel (the former name of the city was Luz).",
      "24": "And when the spies saw a man leaving the city, they said to him, “Please show us the entrance of the city, and we will deal kindly with you.”",

      "27": "Manasseh did not drive out Beth-Sean and its towns, or Taanach and its towns, or the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; the Canaanites were determined to live in this land.",
      "28": "And it happened, when Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they never totally drove them out.",
      "29": "Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in their midst in Gezer.",

      "31": "Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob,",

      "33": "Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or Beth-anath, but lived in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them.",
      "34": "The Amorites pressed the descendants of Dan to the hill country, and they did not allow them to come down to the plain;",
      "35": "the Amorites were determined to live in Har-heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy on them, and they became subjected to forced labor.",

      "1": "And the angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, “I brought you up from Egypt, and I brought you to the land that I had promised to your ancestors. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you.",
      "2": "And as for you, do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; break down their altars.’ But you did not listen to my voice. Why would you do such a thing?",
      "3": "Now I say, I will not drive them out from before you; they will become as thorns for you, and their gods will be a trap for you.”",
      "4": "And as the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the Israelites, the people wept bitterly.",
      "5": "And they called the name of this place Bokim, and there they sacrificed to Yahweh.",
      "6": "And Joshua sent the people away, and the Israelites went each to their own inheritance to take possession of the land.",
      "7": "And the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who saw all the great work Yahweh had done for Israel.",
      "8": "And Joshua son of Nun, servant of Yahweh, died at the age of one hundred and ten years.",
      "9": "They buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnah-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.",
      "10": "Moreover, that entire generation was gathered to their ancestors, and another generation grew up after them who did not know Yahweh or the work he had done for Israel.",
      "11": "The Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and they served the Baals.",
      "12": "They abandoned Yahweh the God of their ancestors, who brought them out from the land of Egypt. They followed other gods from the gods of the people who were around them; and they bowed down to them, and they provoked the anger of Yahweh.",
      "13": "They abandoned Yahweh, and they served Baal and the Ashtaroth.",
      "14": "So the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he gave them into the hand of plunderers; and they plundered them, and he sold them into the hand of their enemies from all sides. They were unable to withstand their enemies any longer.",
      "15": "Whenever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them to harm them, just as Yahweh warned, and just as Yahweh had sworn to them. And they were very distressed.",
      "16": "Then Yahweh raised up leaders, and they delivered them from the hand of their plunderers.",
      "17": "But they did not listen to their leaders, but lusted after other gods and bowed down to them. They turned away quickly from the way that their ancestors went, who had obeyed the commandment of Yahweh; they did not do as their ancestors.",
      "18": "And when Yahweh raised leaders for them, Yahweh was with the leader, and he delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the leader, for Yahweh was moved by their groaning because of their persecutors and oppressors.",
      "19": "But when the leader died they relapsed and acted corruptly, more than their ancestors, following other gods, serving them, and bowing down to them. They would not give up their deeds or their stubborn ways.",
      "20": "So the anger of Yahweh burned against Israel, and he said, “Because this people transgressed my covenant that I commanded their ancestors, and have not obeyed my voice,",
      "21": "I will not again drive out anyone from before them from the nations that Joshua left when he died,",
      "22": "in order to test Israel whether or not they would observe the way of Yahweh, to walk in it just as their ancestors did.”",
      "23": "So Yahweh left those nations; he did not drive them out at once, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua."

      "1": "These are the nations that Yahweh left, to test Israel by them (that is, to test all those who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan,",

      "3": "the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon up to Lebo-Hamath.",
      "4": "They were left for testing Israel, to know whether they would keep the commands of Yahweh that he commanded their ancestors through the hand of Moses.",
      "5": "And the Israelites lived in the midst of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.",
      "6": "And they took their daughters as wives for themselves, and they gave their daughters to their sons, and they served their gods.",
      "7": "The Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. They forgot Yahweh their God, and they served the Baals and the Asheroth.",
      "8": "And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Aram Naharaim; and the Israelites served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.",
      "9": "The Israelites cried out to Yahweh, and Yahweh raised up a deliverer for the Israelites who delivered them, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.",
      "10": "And the spirit of Yahweh came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and Yahweh gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into his hand, and he prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim.",
      "11": "So the land rested forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.",
      "12": "And again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. So Yahweh strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they did evil in the eyes of Yahweh.",
      "13": "He gathered to himself the Ammonites and Amalekites, and he went and defeated Israel, and they took possession of the city of palms.",
      "14": "And the Israelites served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.",
      "15": "And the Israelites cried out to Yahweh, and Yahweh raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjaminite and a left-handed man. And the Israelites sent a tribute to Eglon king of Moab through him.",
      "16": "Ehud made for himself a short, two-edged sword (a cubit in length), and he fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh.",
      "17": "Then he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.",
      "18": "When Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.",
      "19": "But he turned back from the sculptured stones that were near Gilgal, and he said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he said, “Silence!” So all those standing in his presence went out,",
      "20": "and Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool upper room. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” So he got up from his seat.",
      "21": "Then Ehud reached with his left hand for the sword on his right thigh, and he thrust it into his stomach.",
      "22": "And the handle also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade because he did not draw back the sword from his stomach; and it went protruding out the back.",
      "23": "And Ehud went out the vestibule, and he closed the doors of the upper room and locked them behind him.",
      "24": "After he left, his servants returned. When they saw that the doors of the upper room were locked, they thought, “Surely he is relieving himself in the cool inner room.”",
      "25": "And they waited so long they became embarrassed because he did not open the doors of the upper room. So they took the key and opened the doors, and there their lord was lying on the ground dead.",
      "26": "And Ehud escaped while they delayed. He passed by the sculptured stones and escaped to Seirah.",
      "27": "And when he arrived he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down from the hill country with him leading them.",
      "28": "And he said to them, “Follow after me! Yahweh has given Moab your enemies into your hand.” So they went down after him, and they captured the fords of the Jordan toward Moab; and they did not allow anyone to cross over.",
      "29": "And they struck Moab at that time, about ten thousand men, all strong and able men; no one escaped.",
      "30": "And Moab was subdued on that day under the hand of Israel. And the land rested eighty years.",
      "31": "And Shamgar son of Anath came after him, and he killed six hundred Philistines with the goad of an ox; he also delivered Israel."

      "3": "And the Israelites cried to Yahweh, as he had nine hundred iron chariots, and he oppressed the Israelites cruelly for twenty years.",
      "4": "Now at that time Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel.",
      "5": "And she used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites went up to her for judgment.",
      "6": "She sent and called for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh Naphtali and said to him, “Has not Yahweh the God of Israel commanded you? ‘Go, march to Mount Tabor, and take ten thousand men from the descendants of Naphtali and Zebulun.",
      "7": "I will draw out Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and troops, to the wadi of Kishon, and I will give him into your hand.’”",
      "8": "Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I will go; but if you do not go with me, I will not go.”",
      "9": "She said, “Surely I will go with you; however, there will be no glory for you in the path you are taking, for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” And Deborah stood up and went with Barak to Kedesh.",
      "10": "Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and they went up behind him, ten thousand men, and Deborah went up with him.",
      "11": "And Heber the Kenite was separated from the other Kenites, that is, from the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses. And he was encamped at Elon-bezaanannim, which is near Kedesh.",
      "12": "When they reported to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,",
      "13": "Sisera summoned all his chariots—all nine hundred chariots of iron—and the entire army that was with him from Harosheth Haggoyim to the wadi of Kishon.",
      "14": "And Deborah said to Barak, “Get up! This is the day that Yahweh has given Sisera into your hand. Has Yahweh not gone out before you?” So Barak went out from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.",
      "15": "And Yahweh threw Sisera and all his chariots and army into confusion before the edge of Barak’s sword; and Sisera dismounted from his chariot and fled on foot.",
      "16": "But Barak pursued after the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and all of Sisera’s army fell to the edge of the sword; no one was left.",
      "17": "Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.",
      "18": "And Jael came out to meet Sisera, and she said to him, “Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me and do not be afraid.” So he turned aside into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.",
      "19": "And he said to her, “Please, give me a drink of water, because I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin vessel of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.",
      "20": "And he said to her, “Stand at the doorway of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you, and says, ‘Is there anyone here?’ You must answer, ‘No.’”",
      "21": "But Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, took in her hand a tent peg and a hammer, and she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went through into the ground; he was fast asleep since he was exhausted, and he died.",
      "22": "And behold, Barak was pursuing Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him, and she said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” And he came with her and saw that Sisera was lying dead with the peg in his temple.",
      "23": "On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites.",
      "24": "And the hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder on Jabin king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."
