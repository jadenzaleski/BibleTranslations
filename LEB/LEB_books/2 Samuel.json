      "25": "The descendants of Benjamin rallied after Abner, and they became as one fighting group and stood on the top of a certain hill.",

      "27": "Joab said, “As God lives, for if you had not spoken, the people would surely have gone up in the morning, each one of them from following after his brother.”",

Do I not continue to show loyal love with the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends? I have not let you fall into the hands of David, yet you have accused me of sin with this woman today.",
