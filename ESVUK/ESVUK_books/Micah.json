      "3": "For behold, the Lord is coming out of his place,\n    and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.",
      "4": "And the mountains will melt under him,\n    and the valleys will split open,\nlike wax before the fire,\n    like waters poured down a steep place.",
      "5": "All this is for the transgression of Jacob\n    and for the sins of the house of Israel.\nWhat is the transgression of Jacob?\n    Is it not Samaria?\nAnd what is the high place of Judah?\n    Is it not Jerusalem?",
      "6": "Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country,\n    a place for planting vineyards,\nand I will pour down her stones into the valley\n    and uncover her foundations.",
      "7": "All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces,\n    all her wages shall be burned with fire,\n    and all her idols I will lay waste,\nfor from the fee of a prostitute she gathered them,\n    and to the fee of a prostitute they shall return.",
      "8": "For this I will lament and wail;\n    I will go stripped and naked;\nI will make lamentation like the jackals,\n    and mourning like the ostriches.",
      "9": "For her wound is incurable,\n    and it has come to Judah;\nit has reached to the gate of my people,\n    to Jerusalem.",
      "10": "Tell it not in Gath;\n    weep not at all;\nin Beth-le-aphrah\n    roll yourselves in the dust.",
      "11": "Pass on your way,\n    inhabitants of Shaphir,\n    in nakedness and shame;\nthe inhabitants of Zaanan\n    do not come out;\nthe lamentation of Beth-ezel\n    shall take away from you its standing place.",
      "12": "For the inhabitants of Maroth\n    wait anxiously for good,\nbecause disaster has come down from the Lord\n    to the gate of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Harness the steeds to the chariots,\n    inhabitants of Lachish;\nit was the beginning of sin\n    to the daughter of Zion,\nfor in you were found\n    the transgressions of Israel.",
      "14": "Therefore you shall give parting gifts\n    to Moresheth-gath;\nthe houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing\n    to the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "I will again bring a conqueror to you,\n    inhabitants of Mareshah;\nthe glory of Israel\n    shall come to Adullam.",

      "11": "If a man should go about and utter wind and lies,\n    saying, “I will preach to you of wine and strong drink”,\n    he would be the preacher for this people!",
      "12": "I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob;\n    I will gather the remnant of Israel;\nI will set them together\n    like sheep in a fold,\nlike a flock in its pasture,\n    a noisy multitude of men.",
      "13": "He who opens the breach goes up before them;\n    they break through and pass the gate,\n    going out by it.\nTheir king passes on before them,\n    the Lord at their head."
