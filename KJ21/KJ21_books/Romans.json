      "3": "concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,",
      "4": "and was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead,",
      "5": "by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for His name,",
      "6": "among whom ye also are the called of Jesus Christ.",
      "7": "To all who are in Rome, beloved of God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.",
      "9": "For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the Gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,",
      "10": "making request that now at length and by any means I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.",
      "11": "For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end that ye may be established:",
      "12": "that is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith of both you and me.",
      "13": "Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I have purposed to come unto you (but was prevented hitherto), that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.",
      "14": "I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise;",
      "15": "so, as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the Gospel to you also who are at Rome.",
      "16": "For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.",
      "17": "For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith; as it is written: “The just shall live by faith.”",
      "18": "For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,",
      "19": "because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath shown it unto them.",
      "20": "For from the creation of the world the invisible things of Him are clearly seen, being understood through the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.",
      "21": "For when they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God, nor were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.",
      "22": "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,",
      "23": "and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things.",
      "24": "Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies among themselves.",
      "25": "They changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.",
      "26": "For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature.",
      "27": "And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men, working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense for their error which was meet.",
      "28": "And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not fitting,",
      "29": "being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity. They are whisperers,",
      "30": "backbiters, haters of God, spiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,",
      "31": "without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affections, implacable, unmerciful.",

      "3": "And thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest those who do such things and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?",
      "4": "Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?",
      "5": "But because of thy hardness and impenitence of heart, thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the Day of Wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,",

      "7": "to those who by patient continuance in welldoing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life;",

      "10": "but glory, honor and peace to every man who worketh good, to the Jew first and also to the Gentile.",
      "11": "For there is no respect of persons with God.",
      "12": "For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.",
      "13": "(For it is not the hearers of the law who are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.",
      "14": "For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, they, not having the law, are a law unto themselves,",
      "15": "which shows the work of the law written in their hearts,their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts between accusing and excusing one another.)",
      "16": "Thus will it be on the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel.",

      "18": "and knowest His will and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed from the law,",
      "19": "and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,",
      "20": "an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.",
      "21": "Thou therefore who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?",
      "22": "Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?",
      "23": "Thou that makest thy boast in the law, dost thou dishonor God through breaking the law?",
      "24": "For, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you,” as it is written.",
      "25": "For circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.",
      "26": "Therefore if the Uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?",
      "27": "And shall not uncircumcision, which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge thee, who having the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?",
      "28": "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh.",
      "29": "But he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and whose circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter, and whose praise is not from men, but from God."

      "1": "What advantage then hath the Jew? Or what profit is there in circumcision?",

      "4": "God forbid! Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar. As it is written: “That Thou mightest be justified in Thy sayings, and mightest overcome when Thou art judged.”",
      "5": "But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man.)",
      "6": "God forbid! For then how shall God judge the world?",
      "7": "For if the truth of God through my lie hath abounded more unto His glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?",
      "8": "And why not say rather (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), “Let us do evil, that good may come”? Their damnation is just!",
      "9": "What then? Are we better than they? No, in no wise! For we have before proved that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin.",

      "11": "there is none that understandeth; there is none that seeketh after God.",

      "17": "and the way of peace have they not known.”",
      "18": "“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”",
      "19": "Now we know that whatsoever things the law saith, it saith to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God.",
      "20": "Therefore by the deeds of the law, no flesh shall be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin.",
      "21": "But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,",
      "22": "even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all those who believe. For there is no difference,",
      "23": "for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,",
      "24": "being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.",
      "25": "Him God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;",
      "26": "to declare, I say, at this time, His righteousness: that He might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.",
      "27": "Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay, but by the law of faith.",
      "28": "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.",
      "29": "Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,",
      "30": "seeing it is one God who shall justify the Circumcision by faith, and Uncircumcision through faith.",

      "4": "Now to him that worketh, his reward is reckoned not according to grace, but according to debt.",
      "5": "But to him that worketh not, but believeth in Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness,",
      "6": "even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, saying,",
      "7": "“Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered.",
      "8": "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.”",
      "9": "Cometh this blessedness then upon the Circumcision only, or upon the Uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.",
      "10": "How was it then reckoned? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision!",
      "11": "And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are not circumcised, that righteousness might be imputed unto them also,",
      "12": "and the father of circumcision to those who are not of the Circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had, being yet uncircumcised.",
      "13": "For the promise that he should be the heir of the world came not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.",
      "14": "For if those who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect,",
      "15": "because the law worketh wrath; for where there is no law, there is no transgression.",
      "16": "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be given by grace to the end that the promise might be made sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all",
      "17": "(as it is written: “I have made thee a father of many nations”), in the presence of Him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which are not, as though they were.",

      "19": "And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, nor yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb.",

      "21": "and being fully persuaded that what He had promised, He was able also to perform.",

      "11": "And not only that, but we shall also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.",
      "12": "Therefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, so death passed onto all men, for all have sinned.",
      "13": "For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.",
      "14": "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the similitude of Adam’s transgression, he being the figure of Him that was to come.",
      "15": "But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one Man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.",
      "16": "And not as it was by one who sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is for many offenses unto justification.",
      "17": "For if by one man’s offense death reigned by one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "Therefore as by the offense of one, judgment to condemnation came upon all men, even so by the righteousness of One, the free gift unto justification of life came upon all men.",
      "19": "For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.",
      "20": "Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,",

      "4": "Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.",
      "5": "For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, so we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection,",
      "6": "knowing this: that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.",

      "11": "Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "12": "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.",
      "13": "Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.",
      "14": "For sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law, but under grace.",
      "15": "What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid!",
      "16": "Know ye not that to whomever ye yield yourselves as servants to obey, his servants ye become whom ye obey, whether of sin which leads unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?",
      "17": "But God be thanked that though ye were the servants of sin, now ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.",

      "21": "What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.",
      "22": "But now, being made free from sin and having become servants of God, ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end, everlasting life.",

      "8": "But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence; for without the law sin was dead.",
      "9": "For I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died;",
      "10": "and the commandment, which was ordained to bring life, I found to be unto death.",
      "11": "For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me and by it slew me.",
      "12": "Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.",
      "13": "Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid! But sin, that it might appear as sin, was working death in me by that which is good, that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.",

      "15": "For that which I do, I know not. For what I would do, that do I not; but what I hate, that I do.",
      "16": "If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law, that it is good.",
      "17": "Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.",

      "19": "For the good that I would do, I do not; but the evil which I would not do, that I do.",

      "24": "O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?",

      "13": "for if ye live according to the flesh ye shall die, but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live.",
      "14": "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.",

      "20": "For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him who hath subjected the same in hope,",
      "21": "because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.",
      "22": "For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.",
      "23": "And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.",
