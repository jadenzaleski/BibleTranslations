      "1": "Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.",
      "2": "And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick. And he sent messengers and aid unto them, “Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover from this disease.”",
      "3": "But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say unto them, ‘Is it not because there is not a God in Israel that ye go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?’",
      "4": "Now therefore thus saith the Lord: ‘Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou hast gone up, but shalt surely die!’” And Elijah departed.",
      "5": "And when the messengers returned unto the king, he said unto them, “Why have ye now turned back?”",
      "6": "And they said unto him, “There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, ‘Go, return unto the king who sent you and say unto him, “Thus saith the Lord: Is it not because there is not a God in Israel that thou sendest to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? Therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou hast gone up, but shalt surely die!”’”",
      "7": "And he said unto them, “What manner of man was he that came up to meet you and told you these words?”",
      "8": "And they answered him, “He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.” And he said, “It is Elijah he Tishbite.”",
      "9": "Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him; and behold, he sat on the top of a ill. And he spoke unto him, “Thou man of God, the king hath said, ‘Come down.’”",
      "10": "And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, “If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume hee and thy fifty.” And there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.",
      "11": "Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, “O man of God, thus hath the king said, ‘Come down quickly.’”",
      "12": "And Elijah answered and said unto them, “If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty.” And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.",
      "13": "And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him and said unto him, “O man of God, I pray thee, let my life and the life of these fifty, thy servants, be precious in thy sight.",
      "14": "Behold, there came fire down from heaven and burned up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties. Therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight!”",
      "15": "And the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah, “Go down with him; be not afraid of him.” And he arose and went down with him unto the king.",
      "16": "And he said unto him, “Thus saith the Lord: ‘Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word? Therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou hast gone up, but shalt surely die!’”",
      "17": "So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son.",
      "18": "Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"

      "1": "And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.",
      "2": "And Elijah said unto Elisha, “Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel.” And Elisha said unto him, “As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.” So they went down to Bethel.",
      "3": "And the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came forth to Elisha and said unto him, “Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today?” And he said, “Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.”",
      "4": "And Elijah said unto him, “Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho.” And he said, “As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.” So they came to Jericho.",
      "5": "And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him, “Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today?” And he answered, “Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.”",
      "6": "And Elijah said unto him, “Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to the Jordan.” And he said, “As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.” And the two went on.",
      "7": "And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood in sight to view afar off; and they two stood by the Jordan.",
      "8": "And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither so that the two went over on dry ground.",
      "9": "And it came to pass, when they had gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.” And Elisha said, “I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.”",
      "10": "And he said, “Thou hast asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.”",
      "11": "And it came to pass, as they still went on and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.",
      "12": "And Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof!” And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.",
      "13": "He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.",
      "14": "And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters and said, “Where is the Lord God of Elijah?” And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither; and Elisha went over.",
      "15": "And when the sons of the prophets who were in view at Jericho saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.” And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.",
      "16": "And they said unto him, “Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men. Let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.” And he said, “Ye shall not send.”",
      "17": "And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, “Send.” They sent therefore fifty men, and they sought three days but found him not.",
      "18": "And when they came again to him (for he tarried at Jericho), he said unto them, “Did I not say unto you, ‘Go not’?”",
      "19": "And the men of the city said unto Elisha, “Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth; but the water is nought, and the ground barren.”",
      "20": "And he said, “Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein.” And they brought it to him.",
      "21": "And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there and said, “Thus saith the Lord: ‘I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.’”",
      "22": "So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.",
      "23": "And he went up from thence unto Bethel. And as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him and said unto him, “Go up, thou bald head! Go up, thou bald head!”",
      "24": "And he turned back and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two shebears out of the wood and tore forty and two children of them.",
      "25": "And he went from thence to Mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria."

      "1": "Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.",
      "2": "And he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord, but not like his father and like his mother; for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.",
      "3": "Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.",
      "4": "And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams with the wool.",
      "5": "But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.",
      "6": "And King Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time and numbered all Israel.",
      "7": "And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab hath rebelled against me. Wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?” And he said, “I will go up; I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.”",
      "8": "And he said, “Which way shall we go up?” And he answered, “The way through the Wilderness of Edom.”",
      "9": "So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey. And there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them.",
      "10": "And the king of Israel said, “Alas! that the Lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab!”",
      "11": "But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord by him?” And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, “Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.”",
      "12": "And Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.",
      "13": "And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, “What have I to do with thee? Get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother.” And the king of Israel said unto him, “Nay, for the Lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”",
      "14": "And Elisha said, “As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.",
      "15": "But now bring me a minstrel.” And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.",
      "16": "And he said, “Thus saith the Lord: ‘Make this valley full of ditches.’",
      "17": "For thus saith the Lord: ‘Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.’",
      "18": "And this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord; He will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.",
      "19": "And ye shall smite every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.”",
      "20": "And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.",
      "21": "And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered all who were able to put on armor and upward, and stood in the border.",
      "22": "And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood.",
      "23": "And they said, “This is blood! The kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!”",
      "24": "And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.",
      "25": "And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees. Only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; however the slingers went about it and smote it.",
      "26": "And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords to break through even unto the king of Edom, but they could not.",
      "27": "Then he took his eldest son who should have reigned in his stead, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel. And they departed from him, and returned to their own land."

      "2": "And Elisha said unto her, “What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in the house?” And she said, “Thine handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.”",
      "3": "Then he said, “Go, borrow thee vessels abroad from all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.",
      "4": "And when thou hast come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.”",
      "5": "So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.",
      "6": "And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, “Bring me yet a vessel.” And he said unto her, “There is not a vessel more.” And the oil flow ceased.",
      "7": "Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children on the rest.”",
      "8": "And there was a day that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.",
      "9": "And she said unto her husband, “Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passeth by us continually.",
      "10": "Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick. And it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.”",
      "11": "And it fell on a day that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.",
      "12": "And he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” And when he had called her, she stood before him.",
      "13": "And he said unto him, “Say now unto her, ‘Behold, thou hast shown concern for us with all this care. What is to be done for thee? Wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host?’” And she answered, “I dwell among mine own people.”",
      "14": "And he said, “What then is to be done for her?” And Gehazi answered, “Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.”",
      "15": "And he said, “Call her.” And when he had called her, she stood in the door.",

      "23": "And he said, “Why wilt thou go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.” And she said, “It shall be well.”",
      "24": "Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward; slacken not thy riding for me unless I bid thee.”",

      "27": "And when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet; but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, “Let her alone, for her soul is vexed within her; and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.”",
      "28": "Then she said, “Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”",

      "37": "Then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son and went out.",
      "38": "And Elisha came again to Gilgal; and there was a famine in the land. And the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, “Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.”",
      "39": "And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds, his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage, for they knew them not.",
      "40": "So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, “O thou man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat thereof.",
      "41": "But he said, “Then bring meal.” And he cast it into the pot and he said, “Pour out for the people, that they may eat.” And there was no harm in the pot.",

      "43": "And his servitor said, “What, should I set this before a hundred men?” He said again, “Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith the Lord: ‘They shall eat and shall leave some thereof.’”",
