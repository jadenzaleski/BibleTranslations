      "3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,",
      "4": "to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for you,",
      "5": "who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.",
      "6": "In this ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations,",
      "7": "that the trial of your faith (being much more precious than gold that perisheth, though it be tested with fire) might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ,",
      "8": "whom having not seen, ye love. In Him, though now ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory,",
      "9": "receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.",
      "10": "Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, and have prophesied of the grace that should come unto you,",
      "11": "searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them had signified when He testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow.",
      "12": "Unto them it was revealed that they ministered, not unto themselves, but unto us the things which are now reported unto you by those who have preached the Gospel unto you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven — things which the angels desire to look into.",
      "13": "Therefore gird up the loins of your mind; be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.",
      "14": "As obedient children, do not fashion yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance,",
      "15": "but as He who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of living,",
      "16": "because it is written: “Be ye holy, for I am holy.”",
      "17": "And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.",
      "18": "For ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, such as silver and gold, from your vain way of living which ye received by tradition from your fathers,",
      "19": "but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,",
      "20": "who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you.",

      "5": "ye also as living stones are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.",
      "6": "Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture: “Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious; and he that believeth in Him shall not be confounded.”",
      "7": "Unto you therefore who believe, He is precious; but unto those who are disobedient, “The stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,”",
      "8": "and, “A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense,” even to those who stumble at the Word, being disobedient, unto which also they were appointed.",
      "9": "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.",
      "10": "In times past ye were not a people, but are now the people of God; who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.",

      "14": "or unto governors as unto those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do well.",
      "15": "For so is the will of God, that with welldoing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men”",
      "16": "as free, and not using your liberty as a cloak for maliciousness, but as the servants of God.",
      "17": "Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.",
      "18": "Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.",
      "19": "For this is thankworthy: if a man, because of his conscience toward God, endure grief, suffering wrongfully.",
      "20": "For what glory is it if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? But if when ye do well and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.",
      "21": "For even unto this were ye called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow His steps,",
      "22": "“who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth”;",
      "23": "who when He was reviled, reviled not in return; when He suffered, He threatened not, but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously;",
      "24": "who His own self bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.",

      "3": "When adorning yourselves, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing gold, or of putting on apparel;",
      "4": "but let it be the hidden man of the heart which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price.",
      "5": "For in this manner in olden times the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands,",
      "6": "even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. Ye are her daughters as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any bewilderment.",
      "7": "Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with your wives with understanding, giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.",
      "8": "Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one for another. Love each other as brethren, be sympathetic, be courteous,",
      "9": "not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing, knowing that ye are called thereto, that ye might inherit a blessing.",
      "10": "For, “He that would love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.",
      "11": "Let him eschew evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.",
      "12": "For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.”",
      "13": "And who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?",
      "14": "But if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye. “And be not afraid of their terror; neither be troubled.”",
      "15": "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to give an answer to every man who asketh you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.",
      "16": "Have a good conscience, that, whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers, they who falsely accuse may be ashamed by your good manner of life in Christ.",
      "17": "For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for welldoing than for evildoing.",
      "18": "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit,",
      "19": "by which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison,",
      "20": "who one time were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared, wherein few, (that is, eight souls) were saved by water.",
      "21": "The like figure to this, even baptism, doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,",

      "4": "wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same dissolute excess, speaking evil of you,",
      "5": "who shall give account to Him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.",
      "6": "For, for this cause was the Gospel preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.",
      "7": "But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer.",

      "17": "For the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God. And if it first begin with us, what shall the end be of those who obey not the Gospel of God?",
      "18": "And, “If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?”",
