      "14": "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.",
      "15": "Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.",

      "19": "We love Him, because He first loved us.",
      "20": "If a man say, “I love God,” and hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?",

      "5": "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?",
      "6": "This is He that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.",
      "7": "For there are three that bear record in Heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one.",
      "8": "And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in one.",
      "9": "If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater, for this is the witness of God which He hath testified of His Son.",
      "10": "He that believeth in the Son of God hath the witness in himself; he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Son.",
