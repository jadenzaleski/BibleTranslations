      "3": "Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;",
      "5": "that in every thing ye are enriched by Him, in all utterance and in all knowledge,",
      "6": "even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,",
      "7": "so that ye fall behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "8": "He shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "9": "God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "10": "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.",
      "11": "For it hath been reported unto me about you, my brethren, by those who are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.",
      "12": "Now this I say, when every one of you saith, “I am of Paul,” and “I of Apollos,” and “I of Cephas,” and “I of Christ”:",
      "13": "Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?",
      "14": "I thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius,",
      "15": "lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.",
      "16": "And I baptized also the household of Stephanas. Besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.",
      "17": "For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, and not with the wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.",
      "18": "For the preaching of the cross is foolishness to those who perish; but unto us who are saved, it is the power of God.",
      "19": "For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.”",
      "20": "Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?",
      "21": "For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.",
      "22": "For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom;",
      "23": "but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness,",
      "24": "but unto those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
      "25": "For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.",
      "26": "For ye see in your calling, brethren, how not many wise men according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.",
      "27": "But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;",
      "28": "and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things which are,",
      "29": "that no flesh should glory in His presence.",
      "30": "But because of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who from God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption,",

      "3": "And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.",
      "4": "And my speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,",
      "5": "that your faith should not stand on the wisdom of man, but on the power of God.",
      "6": "However, we speak wisdom among those who are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, who are coming to nought.",
      "7": "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world for our glory —",
      "8": "wisdom which none of the princes of this world knew; for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.",
      "9": "But as it is written: “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.”",
      "10": "But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.",
      "11": "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so no man knoweth the things of God, but the Spirit of God.",
      "12": "Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.",
      "13": "These things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.",
      "14": "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.",
      "15": "But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged by no man."

      "2": "I have fed you with milk and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able,",
      "3": "for ye are yet carnal. For if there is among you envying and strife and divisions, are ye not carnal and walk as men?",
      "4": "For while one saith, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of Apollos,” are ye not carnal?",
      "5": "Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye came to believe, even as the Lord gave to every man?",
      "6": "I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.",
      "7": "So then, neither is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God who giveth the increase.",
      "8": "Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one, and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
      "9": "For we are laborers together with God; ye are God’s husbandry; ye are God’s building.",
      "10": "According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.",
      "11": "For no man can lay another foundation than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
      "12": "Now if any man build upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,",
      "13": "every man’s work shall be made manifest; for the Day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall test every man’s work of what sort it is.",
      "14": "If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereon, he shall receive a reward.",
      "15": "If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as fire.",
      "16": "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?",
      "17": "If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, and ye are that temple.",
      "18": "Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.",
      "19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: “He taketh the wise in their own craftiness”;",
      "20": "and again, “The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.”",
      "21": "Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours,",
      "22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come — all are yours,",

      "4": "For I know nothing by myself, yet am I not hereby justified; but He that judgeth me is the Lord.",
      "5": "Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise of God.",
      "6": "And these things, brethren, I have in a sense transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes, that ye may learn through us not to regard men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.",
      "7": "For who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou that thou did not receive? Now if thou did receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou had not been given it?",
      "8": "Now ye are full, now ye are rich! Ye have reigned as kings without us! And I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you!",
      "9": "For I think that God hath set forth us, the apostles, last, as it were approved to death; for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.",
      "10": "We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honorable, but we are despised.",
      "11": "Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place,",
      "12": "and we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;",
      "13": "being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.",
      "14": "I write these things not to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved sons.",
      "15": "For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet ye have not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel.",
      "16": "Therefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.",
      "17": "For this cause I have sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church.",
      "18": "Now some are puffed up as though I would not come to you.",
      "19": "But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and will know, not the speech of those who are puffed up, but the power.",
      "20": "For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.",
      "21": "What will ye have? Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and in the spirit of meekness?"

      "2": "And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.",
      "3": "For I verily, though absent in body but present in spirit, have judged already as though I were present concerning him who hath so done this deed:",
      "4": "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, I being there in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,",

      "6": "Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?",
      "7": "Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ, our Passover, is sacrificed for us.",
      "8": "Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
      "9": "I wrote unto you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators—",
      "10": "yet not meaning altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters, for to do so ye would need to go out of the world.",
      "11": "But I now have written unto you not to keep company with any man who is called a brother if he is a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. With such a one you are not even to eat.",
      "12": "For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do not ye judge those who are within?",

      "12": "But to the rest I speak (not the Lord): if any brother hath a wife who believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.",
      "13": "And the woman who hath a husband who believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.",
      "14": "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband. Else your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.",
      "15": "But if the unbelieving spouse depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases, for God hath called us to peace.",

      "34": "There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.",
      "35": "And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and so that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.",

      "38": "So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well, but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.",
      "39": "The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth. But if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will, but only in the Lord.",
