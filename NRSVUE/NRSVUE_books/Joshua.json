      "1": "After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, the Lord spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’s assistant, saying,",
      "2": "“My servant Moses is dead. Now proceed to cross the Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the Israelites.",
      "3": "Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, as I promised to Moses.",
      "4": "From the wilderness and the Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, to the Great Sea in the west shall be your territory.",
      "5": "No one shall be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you.",
      "6": "Be strong and courageous, for you shall lead this people to possess the land that I swore to their ancestors to give them.",
      "7": "Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to act in accordance with all the law that my servant Moses commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, so that you may be successful wherever you go.",
      "8": "This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to act in accordance with all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall be successful.",
      "9": "I hereby command you: Be strong and courageous; do not be frightened or dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”",
      "10": "Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people,",
      "11": "“Pass through the camp and command the people, ‘Prepare your provisions, for in three days you are to cross over this Jordan, to go in to take possession of the land that the Lord your God gives you to possess.’ ”",
      "12": "But to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,",
      "13": "“Remember the word that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, ‘The Lord your God is providing you a place of rest and will give you this land.’",
      "14": "Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan. But all the warriors among you shall cross over armed before your kindred and shall help them,",
      "15": "until the Lord gives rest to your kindred as well as to you, and they also take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving them. Then you shall return to your own land and take possession of it, the land that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan to the east.”",
      "16": "They answered Joshua, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.",
      "17": "Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. Only may the Lord your God be with you, as he was with Moses!",
      "18": "Whoever rebels against your orders and disobeys your words, whatever you command, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”"

      "1": "Then Joshua son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab and spent the night there.",
      "2": "The king of Jericho was told, “Some Israelites have come here tonight to search out the land.”",
      "3": "Then the king of Jericho sent orders to Rahab, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come to search out the whole land.”",
      "4": "But the woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, “True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they came from.",
      "5": "And when it was time to close the gate at dark, the men went out. Where the men went I do not know. Pursue them quickly, for you can overtake them.”",
      "6": "She had, however, brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax that she had laid out on the roof.",
      "7": "So the men pursued them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords. As soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.",
      "8": "Before they went to sleep, she came up to them on the roof",
      "9": "and said to the men, “I know that the Lord has given you the land and that dread of you has fallen on us and that all the inhabitants of the land melt in fear before you.",
      "10": "For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.",
      "11": "As soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no courage left in any of us because of you. The Lord your God is indeed God in heaven above and on earth below.",
      "12": "Now then, since I have dealt kindly with you, swear to me by the Lord that you in turn will deal kindly with my family. Give me a sign of good faith",
      "13": "that you will spare my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them and deliver our lives from death.”",
      "14": "The men said to her, “Our life for yours! If you do not tell this business of ours, then we will deal kindly and faithfully with you when the Lord gives us the land.”",
      "15": "Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the outer side of the city wall and she resided within the wall itself.",
      "16": "She said to them, “Go toward the hill country, so that the pursuers may not come upon you. Hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned; then afterward you may go your way.”",
      "17": "The men said to her, “We will be released from this oath that you have made us swear to you",
      "18": "if we invade the land and you do not tie this crimson cord in the window through which you let us down and you do not gather into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your family.",
      "19": "If any of you go out of the doors of your house into the street, they shall be responsible for their own death, and we shall be innocent, but if a hand is laid upon any who are with you in the house, we shall bear the responsibility for their death.",
      "20": "But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be released from this oath that you made us swear to you.”",
      "21": "She said, “According to your words, so be it.” She sent them away, and they departed. Then she tied the crimson cord in the window.",
      "22": "They departed and went into the hill country and stayed there three days, until the pursuers returned. The pursuers had searched all along the way and found nothing.",
      "23": "Then the two men came down again from the hill country. They crossed over, came to Joshua son of Nun, and told him all that had happened to them.",
      "24": "They said to Joshua, “Truly the Lord has given all the land into our hands; moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt in fear before us.”"

      "1": "Early in the morning Joshua rose and set out from Shittim with all the Israelites, and they came to the Jordan. They camped there before crossing over.",
      "2": "At the end of three days, the officers went through the camp",
      "3": "and commanded the people, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place. Follow it,",
      "4": "so that you may know the way you should go, for you have not passed this way before. Yet there shall be a space between you and it, a distance of about two thousand cubits; do not come any nearer to it.”",
      "5": "Then Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.”",
      "6": "To the priests Joshua said, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass on in front of the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went in front of the people.",
      "7": "The Lord said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that I will be with you as I was with Moses.",
      "8": "You are the one who shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’ ”",
      "9": "Joshua then said to the Israelites, “Draw near and hear the words of the Lord your God.”",
      "10": "Joshua said, “By this you shall know that among you is the living God who without fail will drive out from before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites:",
      "11": "the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going to pass before you into the Jordan.",
      "12": "So now select twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.",
      "13": "When the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, come to rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan flowing from above shall be cut off; they shall stand in a single heap.”",
      "14": "When the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests bearing the ark of the covenant were in front of the people.",
      "15": "Now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest. So when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the edge of the water,",
      "16": "the waters flowing from above stood still, rising up in a single heap far off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while those flowing toward the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people crossed over opposite Jericho.",
      "17": "While all Israel were crossing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, until the entire nation finished crossing over the Jordan."

      "1": "When the entire nation had finished crossing over the Jordan, the Lord said to Joshua,",

      "4": "Then Joshua summoned the twelve men whom he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe.",
      "5": "Joshua said to them, “Pass on before the ark of the Lord your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,",
      "6": "so that this may be a sign among you. When your children ask in time to come, ‘What do those stones mean to you?’",
      "7": "then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off in front of the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the Israelites a memorial forever.”",
      "8": "The Israelites did as Joshua commanded. They took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the Lord had told Joshua, carried them over with them to the place where they camped, and laid them down there.",
      "9": "(Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood, and they are there to this day.)",
      "10": "The priests who bore the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was finished that the Lord had commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people crossed over in haste.",
      "11": "As soon as all the people had finished crossing over, the ark of the Lord and the priests crossed over to the front of the people.",
      "12": "The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the Israelites, as Moses had ordered them.",
      "13": "About forty thousand armed for war crossed over before the Lord to the plains of Jericho for battle.",
      "14": "On that day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they stood in awe of him, as they had stood in awe of Moses all the days of his life.",

      "19": "The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.",
      "20": "Those twelve stones that they had taken out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal,",

      "22": "then you shall let your children know, ‘Israel crossed over the Jordan here on dry ground.’",
      "23": "For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you crossed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we crossed over,",

      "1": "When all the kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan to the west and all the kings of the Canaanites by the sea heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them because of the Israelites.",
      "2": "At that time the Lord said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites a second time.”",
      "3": "So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath-haaraloth.",
      "4": "This is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the warriors, had died during the journey through the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt.",
      "5": "Although all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people born on the journey through the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised.",
      "6": "For the Israelites traveled forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the warriors who came out of Egypt, perished, not having listened to the voice of the Lord. To them the Lord swore that he would not let them see the land that he had sworn to their ancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.",
      "7": "So it was their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.",
      "8": "When the circumcising of all the nation was done, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed.",
      "9": "The Lord said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away from you the disgrace of Egypt.” And so that place is called Gilgal to this day.",
      "10": "While the Israelites were camped in Gilgal, they kept the Passover in the evening on the fourteenth day of the month in the plains of Jericho.",
      "11": "On the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted grain.",
      "12": "The manna ceased on the day they ate the produce of the land, and the Israelites no longer had manna; they ate the crops of the land of Canaan that year.",
      "13": "Once when Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing before him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you one of us or one of our adversaries?”",
      "14": "He replied, “Neither, but as commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and he said to him, “What do you command your servant, my lord?”",

      "3": "You shall march around the city, all the warriors circling the city once. Thus you shall do for six days,",
      "4": "with seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, the priests blowing the trumpets.",
      "5": "When they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and all the people shall charge straight ahead.”",
      "6": "So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant and have seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark of the Lord.”",
      "7": "To the people he said, “Go forward and march around the city; have the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord.”",
      "8": "As Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the Lord went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the Lord following them.",
      "9": "And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets; the rear guard came after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually.",
      "10": "To the people Joshua gave this command: “You shall not shout or let your voice be heard, nor shall you utter a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.”",
      "11": "So the ark of the Lord went around the city, circling it once, and they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.",
      "12": "Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord.",
      "13": "The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord passed on, blowing the trumpets continually. The armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of the Lord, while the trumpets blew continually.",
      "14": "On the second day they marched around the city once and then returned to the camp. They did this for six days.",
      "15": "On the seventh day they rose early, at dawn, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.",
      "16": "And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For the Lord has given you the city.",
      "17": "The city and all that is in it shall be devoted to the Lord for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live because she hid the messengers we sent.",
      "18": "As for you, keep away from the things devoted to destruction, so as not to covet and take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel an object for destruction, bringing trouble upon it.",
      "19": "But all silver and gold and vessels of bronze and iron are sacred to the Lord; they shall go into the treasury of the Lord.”",
      "20": "So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpets, they raised a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so the people charged straight ahead into the city and captured it.",
      "21": "Then they devoted to destruction by the edge of the sword all in the city, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys.",
      "22": "But to the two men who had spied out the land, Joshua said, “Go into the prostitute’s house, and bring the woman out of it and all who belong to her, as you swore to her.”",
      "23": "So the young men who had been spies went in and brought Rahab out, along with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all who belonged to her—they brought all her kindred out—and set them outside the camp of Israel.",
      "24": "They burned down the city and everything in it; only the silver and gold and the vessels of bronze and iron they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.",
      "25": "But Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, Joshua spared. Her family has lived in Israel ever since. For she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.",
      "26": "Joshua then pronounced this oath, saying,\n“Cursed before the Lord be anyone who tries\n    to build this city, Jericho!\nAt the cost of his firstborn he shall lay its foundation,\n    and at the cost of his youngest he shall set up its gates!”",
      "27": "So the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land."

      "1": "But the Israelites broke faith in regard to the devoted things: Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things, and the anger of the Lord burned against the Israelites.",
      "2": "Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” And the men went up and spied out Ai.",
      "3": "Then they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Not all the people need go up; about two or three thousand men should go up and attack Ai. Since they are so few, do not make the whole people toil up there.”",
      "4": "So about three thousand of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.",
      "5": "The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, chasing them from outside the gate as far as Shebarim and killing them on the slope. The hearts of the people melted and turned to water.",
      "6": "Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of the Lord until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they put dust on their heads.",
      "7": "Joshua said, “Ah, Lord God! Why have you brought this people across the Jordan at all, to hand us over to the Amorites so as to destroy us? Would that we had been content to settle beyond the Jordan!",
      "8": "O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has turned their backs to their enemies!",
      "9": "The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and surround us and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will you do for your great name?”",
      "10": "The Lord said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why have you fallen on your face?",
      "11": "Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I imposed on them. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have acted deceitfully, and they have put them among their own belongings.",
      "12": "Therefore the Israelites are unable to stand before their enemies; they turn their backs to their enemies because they have become a thing devoted for destruction themselves. I will be with you no more unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.",
      "13": "Proceed to sanctify the people and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: There are devoted things among you, O Israel; you will be unable to stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you.",
      "14": "In the morning, therefore, you shall come forward tribe by tribe. The tribe that the Lord takes shall come near by clans, the clan that the Lord takes shall come near by households, and the household that the Lord takes shall come near one by one.",
      "15": "And the one who is taken as having the devoted things shall be burned with fire, together with all that he has, for having transgressed the covenant of the Lord and for having done an outrageous thing in Israel.’ ”",
      "16": "So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken.",
      "17": "He brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken, and he brought near the clan of the Zerahites by households, and Zabdi was taken.",
      "18": "And he brought near his household one by one, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.",

      "21": "when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. They now lie hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”",
      "22": "So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.",
      "23": "They took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and they spread them out before the Lord.",
      "24": "Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan son of Zerah, with the silver, the mantle, and the bar of gold, with his sons and daughters, with his oxen, donkeys, and sheep, and his tent and all that he had, and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.",
      "25": "Joshua said, “Why did you bring trouble on us? The Lord is bringing trouble on you today.” And all Israel stoned him to death; they burned them with fire, cast stones on them,",
      "26": "and raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from his burning anger. Therefore that place to this day is called the Valley of Achor."

      "2": "You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may take its spoil and plunder its livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush against the city, behind it.”",

      "12": "Taking about five thousand men, he set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.",
      "13": "So they stationed the forces, the main encampment that was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city, and Joshua went that night into the valley.",
      "14": "When the king of Ai saw this, he and all his people, the inhabitants of the city, hurried out early in the morning to the meeting place facing the Arabah to meet Israel in battle, but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.",
      "15": "And Joshua and all Israel made a pretense of being beaten before them and fled in the direction of the wilderness.",
