      "4": "in him was life, and the life was the light of all people.",
      "5": "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overtake it.",
      "6": "There was a man sent from God whose name was John.",
      "7": "He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him.",
      "8": "He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light.",
      "9": "The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.",
      "10": "He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, yet the world did not know him.",
      "11": "He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him.",
      "12": "But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God,",
      "13": "who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.",
      "14": "And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth.",
      "15": "(John testified to him and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me.’ ”)",
      "16": "From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.",
      "17": "The law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "No one has ever seen God. It is the only Son, himself God, who is close to the Father’s heart, who has made him known.",
      "19": "This is the testimony given by John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”",
      "20": "He confessed and did not deny it, but he confessed, “I am not the Messiah.”",
      "21": "And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the prophet?” He answered, “No.”",
      "22": "Then they said to him, “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”",
      "23": "He said,\n“I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,\n‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ ”\nas the prophet Isaiah said.",
      "24": "Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.",
      "25": "They asked him, “Why, then, are you baptizing if you are neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”",
      "26": "John answered them, “I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not know,",
      "27": "the one who is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal.”",
      "28": "This took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.",
      "29": "The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and declared, “Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!",
      "30": "This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me.’",
      "31": "I myself did not know him, but I came baptizing with water for this reason, that he might be revealed to Israel.”",
      "32": "And John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.",
      "33": "I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’",
      "34": "And I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Chosen One.”",
      "35": "The next day John again was standing with two of his disciples,",
      "36": "and as he watched Jesus walk by he exclaimed, “Look, here is the Lamb of God!”",
      "37": "The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.",
      "38": "When Jesus turned and saw them following, he said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which translated means Teacher), “where are you staying?”",
      "39": "He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where he was staying, and they remained with him that day. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon.",
      "40": "One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.",
      "41": "He first found his brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated Anointed).",
      "42": "He brought Simon to Jesus, who looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You are to be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).",
      "43": "The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”",
      "44": "Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.",
      "45": "Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him about whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote, Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.”",
      "46": "Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”",
      "47": "When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said of him, “Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!”",
      "48": "Nathanael asked him, “Where did you get to know me?” Jesus answered, “I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.”",
      "49": "Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”",
      "50": "Jesus answered, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.”",
      "51": "And he said to him, “Very truly, I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”"

      "1": "On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.",
      "2": "Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.",
      "3": "When the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.”",
      "4": "And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what concern is that to me and to you? My hour has not yet come.”",
      "5": "His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”",
      "6": "Now standing there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.",
      "7": "Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.",
      "8": "He said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the person in charge of the banquet.” So they took it.",
      "9": "When the person in charge tasted the water that had become wine and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), that person called the bridegroom",
      "10": "and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now.”",
      "11": "Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.",
      "12": "After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they remained there a few days.",
      "13": "The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "14": "In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves and the money changers seated at their tables.",
      "15": "Making a whip of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, with the sheep and the cattle. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.",
      "16": "He told those who were selling the doves, “Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!”",
      "17": "His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”",
      "18": "The Jews then said to him, “What sign can you show us for doing this?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”",
      "20": "The Jews then said, “This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?”",
      "21": "But he was speaking of the temple of his body.",
      "22": "After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.",
      "23": "When he was in Jerusalem during the Passover festival, many believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing.",
      "24": "But Jesus on his part would not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people",
      "25": "and needed no one to testify about anyone, for he himself knew what was in everyone."

      "1": "Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews.",
      "2": "He came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with that person.”",
      "3": "Jesus answered him, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.”",
      "4": "Nicodemus said to him, “How can anyone be born after having grown old? Can one enter a second time into the mother’s womb and be born?”",
      "5": "Jesus answered, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.",
      "6": "What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘You must be born from above.’",
      "8": "The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”",
      "9": "Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?”",
      "10": "Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?",
      "11": "“Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, yet you do not receive our testimony.",
      "12": "If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?",
      "13": "No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.",
      "14": "And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,",
      "15": "that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.",
      "16": "“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.",
      "17": "“Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him.",
      "18": "Those who believe in him are not condemned, but those who do not believe are condemned already because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God.",
      "19": "And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.",
      "20": "For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light, so that their deeds may not be exposed.",
      "21": "But those who do what is true come to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.”",
      "22": "After this Jesus and his disciples went into the region of Judea, and he spent some time there with them and baptized.",
      "23": "John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim because water was abundant there, and people kept coming and were being baptized.",
      "24": "(John, of course, had not yet been thrown into prison.)",
      "25": "Now a discussion about purification arose between John’s disciples and a Jew.",
      "26": "They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you testified, here he is baptizing, and all are going to him.”",
      "27": "John answered, “No one can receive anything except what has been given from heaven.",
      "28": "You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah, but I have been sent ahead of him.’",
      "29": "He who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. For this reason my joy has been fulfilled.",
      "30": "He must increase, but I must decrease.”",
      "31": "The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is above all.",
      "32": "He testifies to what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony.",
      "33": "Whoever has accepted his testimony has certified this, that God is true.",
      "34": "He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.",
      "35": "The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in his hands.",
      "36": "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever disobeys the Son will not see life but must endure God’s wrath."

      "3": "he left Judea and started back to Galilee.",
      "4": "But he had to go through Samaria.",
      "5": "So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.",
      "6": "Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon.",
      "7": "A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.”",
      "8": "(His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.)",
      "9": "The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?” (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.)",
      "10": "Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”",
      "11": "The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?",
      "12": "Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?”",
      "13": "Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,",
      "14": "but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.”",
      "15": "The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.”",
      "16": "Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come back.”",
      "17": "The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband,’",
      "18": "for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!”",
      "19": "The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.",
      "20": "Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.”",
      "21": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.",
      "22": "You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.",
      "23": "But the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him.",

      "27": "Just then his disciples came. They were astonished that he was speaking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you want?” or, “Why are you speaking with her?”",
      "28": "Then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city. She said to the people,",
      "29": "“Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done! He cannot be the Messiah, can he?”",
      "30": "They left the city and were on their way to him.",

      "32": "But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”",
      "33": "So the disciples said to one another, “Surely no one has brought him something to eat?”",
      "34": "Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work.",
      "35": "Do you not say, ‘Four months more, then comes the harvest’? But I tell you, look around you, and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting.",
      "36": "The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.",
      "37": "For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’",
      "38": "I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”",
      "39": "Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I have ever done.”",
      "40": "So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.",
      "41": "And many more believed because of his word.",
      "42": "They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world.”",
      "43": "When the two days were over, he went from that place to Galilee",
      "44": "(for Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in the prophet’s own country).",
      "45": "When he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, since they had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the festival, for they, too, had gone to the festival.",
      "46": "Then he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had changed the water into wine. Now there was a royal official whose son lay ill in Capernaum.",
      "47": "When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.",
      "48": "Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.”",
      "49": "The official said to him, “Sir, come down before my little boy dies.”",
      "50": "Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way.",
      "51": "As he was going down, his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive.",
      "52": "So he asked them the hour when he began to recover, and they said to him, “Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him.”",
      "53": "The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” So he himself believed, along with his whole household.",
      "54": "Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee."

      "1": "After this there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Now in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate there is a pool, called in Hebrew Beth-zatha, which has five porticoes.",
      "3": "In these lay many ill, blind, lame, and paralyzed people.",
      "4": "",
      "5": "One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.",
      "6": "When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been there a long time, he said to him, “Do you want to be made well?”",
      "7": "The ill man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am making my way someone else steps down ahead of me.”",
      "8": "Jesus said to him, “Stand up, take your mat and walk.”",
      "9": "At once the man was made well, and he took up his mat and began to walk.\nNow that day was a Sabbath.",
      "10": "So the Jews said to the man who had been cured, “It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.”",
      "11": "But he answered them, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Take up your mat and walk.’ ”",
      "12": "They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take it up and walk’?”",
      "13": "Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had disappeared in the crowd that was there.",
      "14": "Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you have been made well! Do not sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”",
      "15": "The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.",
      "16": "Therefore the Jews started persecuting Jesus, because he was doing such things on the Sabbath.",
      "17": "But Jesus answered them, “My Father is still working, and I also am working.”",
      "18": "For this reason the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because he was not only breaking the Sabbath but was also calling God his own Father, thereby making himself equal to God.",
      "19": "Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing on his own but only what he sees the Father doing, for whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.",
      "20": "The Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing, and he will show him greater works than these, so that you will be astonished.",
      "21": "Indeed, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes.",
      "22": "The Father judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son,",
      "23": "so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.",
      "24": "Very truly, I tell you, anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and does not come under judgment but has passed from death to life.",
      "25": "“Very truly, I tell you, the hour is coming and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.",

      "36": "But I have a testimony greater than John’s. The works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me.",

      "16": "A second time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Tend my sheep.”",
      "17": "He said to him the third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time, “Do you love me?” And he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep.",
      "18": "Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.”",
