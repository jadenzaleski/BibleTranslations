      "6": "For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands,",
      "7": "for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self-discipline.",
      "8": "Do not be ashamed, then, of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel, in the power of God,",
      "9": "who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace, and this grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,",

      "16": "Avoid profane chatter, for it will lead people into more and more impiety,",
      "17": "and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,",
      "18": "who have swerved from the truth, saying resurrection has already occurred. They are upsetting the faith of some.",
