      "1": "Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,\nTo our beloved coworker Philemon,",
      "2": "to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus, and to the church in your house:",
      "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "4": "I thank my God always when I mention you in my prayers,",
      "5": "because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the Lord Jesus.",
      "6": "I pray that the partnership of your faith may become effective as you comprehend all the good that we share in Christ.",
      "7": "I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother.",
      "8": "For this reason, though I am more than bold enough in Christ to command you to do the right thing,",
      "9": "yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love—and I, Paul, do this as an old man and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus.",
      "10": "I am appealing to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment.",
      "11": "Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.",
      "12": "I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.",
      "13": "I wanted to keep him with me so that he might minister to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel,",
      "14": "but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced.",
      "15": "Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back for the long term,",
      "16": "no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.",
      "17": "So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.",
      "18": "If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to me.",
      "19": "I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. I say nothing about your owing me even your own self.",
      "20": "Yes, brother, let me have this benefit from you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ.",
      "21": "Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.",
      "22": "One thing more: prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping through your prayers to be restored to you.",
      "23": "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,",
      "24": "and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my coworkers.",
      "25": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
