  "Mark": {
    "1": {
      "1": "The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ.",
      "2": "As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,\n“See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,\n    who will prepare your way,",
      "3": "the voice of one crying out in the wilderness:\n    ‘Prepare the way of the Lord;\n    make his paths straight,’ ”",
      "4": "so John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
      "5": "And the whole Judean region and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him and were baptized by him in the River Jordan, confessing their sins.",
      "6": "Now John was clothed with camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.",
      "7": "He proclaimed, “The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of his sandals.",
      "8": "I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”",
      "9": "In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.",
      "10": "And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove upon him.",
      "11": "And a voice came from the heavens, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.”",
      "12": "And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.",
      "13": "He was in the wilderness forty days, tested by Satan, and he was with the wild beasts, and the angels waited on him.",
      "14": "Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the good news of God",
      "15": "and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.”",
      "16": "As Jesus passed along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers.",
      "17": "And Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of people.”",
      "18": "And immediately they left their nets and followed him.",
      "19": "As he went a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets.",
      "20": "Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.",
      "21": "They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and taught.",
      "22": "They were astounded at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes.",
      "23": "Just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit,",
      "24": "and he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.”",
      "25": "But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet and come out of him!”",
      "26": "And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.",
      "27": "They were all amazed, and they kept on asking one another, “What is this? A new teaching—with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”",
      "28": "At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.",
      "29": "As soon as they left the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.",
      "30": "Now Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once.",
      "31": "He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. Then the fever left her, and she began to serve them.",
      "32": "That evening, at sunset, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed by demons.",
      "33": "And the whole city was gathered around the door.",
      "34": "And he cured many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons, and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.",
      "35": "In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed.",
      "36": "And Simon and his companions hunted for him.",
      "37": "When they found him, they said to him, “Everyone is searching for you.”",
      "38": "He answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns, so that I may proclaim the message there also, for that is what I came out to do.”",
      "39": "And he went throughout all Galilee, proclaiming the message in their synagogues and casting out demons.",
      "40": "A man with a skin disease came to him begging him, and kneeling he said to him, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”",
      "41": "Moved with pity, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, “I am willing. Be made clean!”",
      "42": "Immediately the skin disease left him, and he was made clean.",
      "43": "After sternly warning him he sent him away at once,",
      "44": "saying to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded as a testimony to them.”",
      "45": "But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word, so that Jesus could no longer go into a town openly but stayed out in the country, and people came to him from every quarter."

    "2": {
      "1": "When he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home.",
      "2": "So many gathered around that there was no longer room for them, not even in front of the door, and he was speaking the word to them.",
      "3": "Then some people came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them.",
      "4": "And when they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and after having dug through it, they let down the mat on which the paralytic lay.",
      "5": "When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”",
      "6": "Now some of the scribes were sitting there questioning in their hearts,",
      "7": "“Why does this fellow speak in this way? It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”",
      "8": "At once Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves, and he said to them, “Why do you raise such questions in your hearts?",
      "9": "Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and take your mat and walk’?",
      "10": "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic—",
      "11": "“I say to you, stand up, take your mat, and go to your home.”",
      "12": "And he stood up and immediately took the mat and went out before all of them, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”",
      "13": "Jesus went out again beside the sea; the whole crowd gathered around him, and he taught them.",
      "14": "As he was walking along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax-collection station, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.",
      "15": "And as he sat at dinner in Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were also sitting with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.",
      "16": "When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”",
      "17": "When Jesus heard this, he said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick; I have not come to call the righteous but sinners.”",
      "18": "Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and people came and said to him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”",
      "19": "Jesus said to them, “The wedding attendants cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.",
      "20": "The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.",
      "21": "“No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak; otherwise, the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.",
      "22": "Similarly, no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and so are the skins, but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins.”",
      "23": "One Sabbath he was going through the grain fields, and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.",
      "24": "The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”",
      "25": "And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food,",
      "26": "how he entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and he gave some to his companions?”",
      "27": "Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for humankind and not humankind for the Sabbath,",
      "28": "so the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand.",
      "2": "They were watching him to see whether he would cure him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.",
      "3": "And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come forward.”",
      "4": "Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.",
      "5": "He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.",
      "6": "The Pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.",
      "7": "Jesus departed with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him;",
      "8": "hearing all that he was doing, they came to him in great numbers from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.",
      "9": "He told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, so that they would not crush him,",
      "10": "for he had cured many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.",
      "11": "Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and shouted, “You are the Son of God!”",
      "12": "But he sternly ordered them not to make him known.",
      "13": "He went up the mountain and called to him those whom he wanted, and they came to him.",
      "14": "And he appointed twelve to be with him and to be sent out to preach",
      "15": "and to have authority to cast out demons.",
      "16": "So he appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter),",
      "17": "James son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder),",
      "18": "and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,",
      "19": "and Judas Iscariot, who handed him over.",
      "20": "Then he went home, and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat.",
      "21": "When his family heard it, they went out to restrain him, for people were saying, “He has gone out of his mind.”",
      "22": "And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul, and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons.”",
      "23": "And he called them to him and spoke to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?",
      "24": "If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.",
      "25": "And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.",
      "26": "And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but his end has come.",
      "27": "But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man; then indeed the house can be plundered.",
      "28": "“Truly I tell you, people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter,",
      "29": "but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin”—",
      "30": "for they had said, “He has an unclean spirit.”",
      "31": "Then his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him.",
      "32": "A crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.”",
      "33": "And he replied, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”",
      "34": "And looking at those who sat around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!",
      "35": "Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Again he began to teach beside the sea. Such a very large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the sea and sat there, while the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.",
      "2": "He began to teach them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them:",
      "3": "“Listen! A sower went out to sow.",
      "4": "And as he sowed, some seed fell on a path, and the birds came and ate it up.",
      "5": "Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up quickly, since it had no depth of soil.",
      "6": "And when the sun rose, it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away.",
      "7": "Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.",
      "8": "Other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.”",
      "9": "And he said, “If you have ears to hear, then hear!”",
      "10": "When he was alone, those who were around him along with the twelve asked him about the parables.",
      "11": "And he said to them, “To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything comes in parables,",
      "12": "in order that\n‘they may indeed look but not perceive,\n    and may indeed hear but not understand;\nso that they may not turn again and be forgiven.’ ”",
      "13": "And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables?",
      "14": "The sower sows the word.",
      "15": "These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them.",
      "16": "And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: when they hear the word, they immediately receive it with joy.",
      "17": "But they have no root and endure only for a while; then, when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.",
      "18": "And others are those sown among the thorns: these are the ones who hear the word,",
      "19": "but the cares of the age and the lure of wealth and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it yields nothing.",
      "20": "And these are the ones sown on the good soil: they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.”",
      "21": "He said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket or under the bed and not on the lampstand?",
      "22": "For there is nothing hidden, except to be disclosed; nor is anything secret, except to come to light.",
      "23": "If you have ears to hear, then hear!”",
      "24": "And he said to them, “Pay attention to what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get, and it will be added to you.",
      "25": "For to those who have, more will be given, and from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.”",
      "26": "He also said, “The kingdom of God is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground",
      "27": "and would sleep and rise night and day, and the seed would sprout and grow, he does not know how.",
      "28": "The earth produces of itself first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.",
      "29": "But when the grain is ripe, at once he goes in with his sickle because the harvest has come.”",
      "30": "He also said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable will we use for it?",
      "31": "It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth,",
      "32": "yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.”",
      "33": "With many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it;",
      "34": "he did not speak to them except in parables, but he explained everything in private to his disciples.",
      "35": "On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let us go across to the other side.”",
      "36": "And leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. Other boats were with him.",
      "37": "A great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped.",
      "38": "But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?”",
      "39": "And waking up, he rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Be silent! Be still!” Then the wind ceased, and there was a dead calm.",
      "40": "He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?”",
      "41": "And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "They came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.",
      "2": "And when he had stepped out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met him.",
      "3": "He lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him any more, even with a chain,",
      "4": "for he had often been restrained with shackles and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces, and no one had the strength to subdue him.",
      "5": "Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always howling and bruising himself with stones.",
      "6": "When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him,",
      "7": "and he shouted at the top of his voice, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.”",
      "8": "For he had said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”",
      "9": "Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He replied, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”",
      "10": "He begged him earnestly not to send them out of the region.",
      "11": "Now there on the hillside a great herd of swine was feeding,",
      "12": "and the unclean spirits begged him, “Send us into the swine; let us enter them.”",
      "13": "So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine, and the herd, numbering about two thousand, stampeded down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea.",
      "14": "The swineherds ran off and told it in the city and in the country. Then people came to see what it was that had happened.",
      "15": "They came to Jesus and saw the man possessed by demons sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had had the legion, and they became frightened.",
      "16": "Those who had seen what had happened to the man possessed by demons and to the swine reported it.",
      "17": "Then they began to beg Jesus to leave their neighborhood.",
      "18": "As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.",
      "19": "But Jesus refused and said to him, “Go home to your own people, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and what mercy he has shown you.”",
      "20": "And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone was amazed.",
      "21": "When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea.",
      "22": "Then one of the leaders of the synagogue, named Jairus, came and, when he saw him, fell at his feet",
      "23": "and pleaded with him repeatedly, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.”",
      "24": "So he went with him.\nAnd a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him.",
      "25": "Now there was a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years.",
      "26": "She had endured much under many physicians and had spent all that she had, and she was no better but rather grew worse.",
      "27": "She had heard about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,",
      "28": "for she said, “If I but touch his cloak, I will be made well.”",
      "29": "Immediately her flow of blood stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.",
      "30": "Immediately aware that power had gone forth from him, Jesus turned about in the crowd and said, “Who touched my cloak?”",
      "31": "And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing in on you; how can you say, ‘Who touched me?’ ”",
      "32": "He looked all around to see who had done it.",
      "33": "But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him, and told him the whole truth.",
      "34": "He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”",
      "35": "While he was still speaking, some people came from the synagogue leader’s house to say, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the teacher any further?”",
      "36": "But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the synagogue leader, “Do not be afraid; only believe.”",
      "37": "He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.",
      "38": "When they came to the synagogue leader’s house, he saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly.",
      "39": "When he had entered, he said to them, “Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.”",
      "40": "And they laughed at him. Then he put them all outside and took the child’s father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was.",
      "41": "Taking her by the hand, he said to her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, get up!”",
      "42": "And immediately the girl stood up and began to walk about (she was twelve years of age). At this they were overcome with amazement.",
      "43": "He strictly ordered them that no one should know this and told them to give her something to eat."

    "6": {
      "1": "He left that place and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.",
      "2": "On the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astounded. They said, “Where did this man get all this? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by his hands!",
      "3": "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.",
      "4": "Then Jesus said to them, “Prophets are not without honor, except in their hometown and among their own kin and in their own house.”",
      "5": "And he could do no deed of power there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them.",
      "6": "And he was amazed at their unbelief.\nThen he went about among the villages teaching.",
      "7": "He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.",
      "8": "He ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff: no bread, no bag, no money in their belts,",
      "9": "but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics.",
      "10": "He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.",
      "11": "If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you, as you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.”",
      "12": "So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent.",
      "13": "They cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.",
      "14": "King Herod heard of it, for Jesus’s name had become known. Some were saying, “John the baptizer has been raised from the dead, and for this reason these powers are at work in him.”",
      "15": "But others said, “It is Elijah.” And others said, “It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”",
      "16": "But when Herod heard of it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”",
      "17": "For Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because Herod had married her.",
      "18": "For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”",
      "19": "And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But she could not,",
      "20": "for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he liked to listen to him.",
      "21": "But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and for the leaders of Galilee.",
      "22": "When his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests, and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it.”",
      "23": "And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom.”",
      "24": "She went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” She replied, “The head of John the baptizer.”",

      "5": "As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.",
      "6": "But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him.",
      "7": "But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.”",
