      "1": "The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Kings Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Hear, you peoples, all of you;\n    listen, O earth, and all that is in it,\nand let the Lord God be a witness against you,\n    the Lord from his holy temple.",
      "3": "For the Lord is coming out of his place\n    and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.",
      "4": "Then the mountains will melt under him,\n    and the valleys will burst open\nlike wax near the fire,\n    like waters poured down a slope.",
      "5": "All this is for the transgression of Jacob\n    and for the sins of the house of Israel.\nWhat is the transgression of Jacob?\n    Is it not Samaria?\nAnd what is the high place of Judah?\n    Is it not Jerusalem?",
      "6": "Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country,\n    a place for planting vineyards.\nI will pour down her stones into the valley\n    and uncover her foundations.",
      "7": "All her images shall be beaten to pieces,\n    all her wages shall be burned with fire,\n    and all her idols I will lay waste;\nfor as the wages of a prostitute she gathered them,\n    and as the wages of a prostitute they shall again be used.",
      "8": "For this I will lament and wail;\n    I will go barefoot and naked;\nI will make lamentation like the jackals\n    and mourning like the ostriches.",
      "9": "For her wound is incurable.\n    It has come to Judah;\nit has reached to the gate of my people,\n    to Jerusalem.",
      "10": "Tell it not in Gath;\n    weep not at all;\nin Beth-leaphrah\n    roll yourselves in the dust.",
      "11": "Pass on your way,\n    inhabitants of Shaphir,\n    in nakedness and shame;\nthe inhabitants of Zaanan\n    do not come forth;\nBeth-ezel is wailing\n    and shall remove its support from you.",
      "12": "For the inhabitants of Maroth\n    wait anxiously for good,\nyet disaster has come down from the Lord\n    to the gate of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Harness the steeds to the chariots,\n    inhabitants of Lachish;\nit was the beginning of sin\n    to daughter Zion,\nfor in you were found\n    the transgressions of Israel.",
      "14": "Therefore you shall give parting gifts\n    to Moresheth-gath;\nthe houses of Achzib shall be a deception\n    to the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "I will again bring a conqueror upon you,\n    inhabitants of Mareshah;\nthe glory of Israel\n    shall come to Adullam.",

      "3": "Therefore thus says the Lord:\nNow, I am devising against this family an evil\n    from which you cannot remove your necks,\nand you shall not walk arrogantly,\n    for it will be an evil time.",
      "4": "On that day they shall take up a taunt song against you\n    and wail with bitter lamentation\nand say, “We are utterly ruined;\n    the Lord alters the inheritance of my people;\nhow he removes it from me!\n    Among our captors he parcels out our fields.”",
      "5": "Therefore you will have no one in the Lord’s assembly\n    to allot you a piece of land.",
      "6": "“Do not preach”—thus they preach—\n    “one should not preach of such things;\n    disgrace will not overtake us.”",
      "7": "Should this be said, O house of Jacob?\n    Is the Lord’s patience exhausted?\n    Are these his doings?\nDo not my words do good\n    to one who walks uprightly?",
      "8": "But you rise up against my people as an enemy;\n    you strip the robe from the peaceful,\nfrom those who pass by trustingly\n    with no thought of war.",
      "9": "The women of my people you drive out\n    from their pleasant houses;\nfrom their young children you take away\n    my glory forever.",

      "11": "If someone were to go about uttering empty falsehoods,\n    saying, “I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,”\n    such a one would be the preacher for this people!",
      "12": "I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob;\n    I will gather the survivors of Israel;\nI will set them together\n    like sheep in a fold,\nlike a flock in its pasture;\n    it will resound with people.",
      "13": "The one who breaks out will go up before them;\n    they will break through and pass the gate,\n    going out by it.\nTheir king will pass on before them,\n    the Lord at their head."

      "3": "who eat the flesh of my people,\n    flay their skin off them,\nbreak their bones in pieces,\n    and chop them up like meat in a kettle,\n    like flesh in a caldron.",
      "4": "Then they will cry to the Lord,\n    but he will not answer them;\nhe will hide his face from them at that time\n    because they have acted wickedly.",
      "5": "Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets\n    who lead my people astray,\nwho cry “Peace”\n    when they have something to eat\nbut declare war against those\n    who put nothing into their mouths.",
      "6": "Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision,\n    and darkness to you, without revelation.\nThe sun shall go down upon the prophets,\n    and the day shall be black over them;",
      "7": "the seers shall be disgraced\n    and the diviners put to shame;\nthey shall all cover their lips,\n    for there is no answer from God.",

      "9": "Hear this, you rulers of the house of Jacob\n    and chiefs of the house of Israel,\nwho abhor justice\n    and pervert all equity,",
      "10": "who build Zion with blood\n    and Jerusalem with wrong!",
      "11": "Its rulers give judgment for a bribe;\n    its priests teach for a price;\n    its prophets give oracles for money;\nyet they lean upon the Lord and say,\n    “Surely the Lord is with us!\n    No harm shall come upon us.”",
      "12": "Therefore because of you\n    Zion shall be plowed as a field;\nJerusalem shall become a heap of ruins,\n    and the mountain of the temple a wooded height."

      "10": "Writhe and groan, O daughter Zion,\n    like a woman in labor,\nfor now you shall go forth from the city\n    and camp in the open country;\n    you shall go to Babylon.\nThere you shall be rescued;\n    there the Lord will redeem you\n    from the hands of your enemies.",
