      "4": "nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which generate questions other than that the edification of God is by faith.",
      "5": "Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned:",
      "6": "from which some, having swerved, have turned aside unto vanity of words,",
      "7": "desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor from where they affirm.",

      "13": "who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious, but I was received unto mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.",
      "14": "And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.",
      "15": "This is a faithful saying and worthy of acceptation by all, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am first.",
      "16": "But for this cause I was received unto mercy that in me first, Jesus Christ might show forth all clemency, for an example to those who should hereafter believe in him for eternal life.",
