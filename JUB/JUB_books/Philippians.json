      "1": "Paul and Timothy, slaves of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:",
      "2": "Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "3": "I thank my God upon every remembrance of you",
      "4": "always in every prayer of mine for you all, making request with joy,",
      "5": "for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now,",
      "6": "being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ.",
      "7": "Even as it is right for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are joint partakers of my grace.",
      "8": "For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.",
      "9": "And this I pray that your charity may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all perception,",
      "10": "that ye may approve the best, that ye may be sincere and without offense until the day of Christ,",
      "11": "being filled with fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.",
      "12": "But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel,",
      "13": "so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places;",
      "14": "and many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.",
      "15": "Some indeed preach the Christ even out of envy and strife, but others also out of good will.",
      "16": "Some preach the Christ out of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add tribulation to my bonds,",
      "17": "but the others out of charity, knowing that I am placed here for the defense of the gospel.",
      "18": "What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice, and will even rejoice.",
      "19": "For I know that this shall become my saving health through your prayer and the nourishment of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,",
      "20": "according to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.",
      "21": "For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.",
      "22": "But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour, yet I do not know what to choose.",
      "23": "For I am in a strait between the two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better:",
      "24": "nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.",
      "25": "And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith,",
      "26": "that your glorying in Jesus Christ may be more abundant by my coming to you again.",
      "27": "Only let your conversation be as is worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, unanimous, working together for the faith of the gospel,",
      "28": "and in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of saving health and that of God.",
      "29": "For unto you it is granted regarding Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake,",
      "30": "having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,",
      "2": "fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same charity, unanimous, minding the one thing.",
      "3": "Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory, but in humility let each esteem others better than themselves,",
      "4": "with each one not looking to their own things, but also to the things of others.",
      "5": "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,",
      "6": "who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God,",
      "7": "but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, made in the likeness of men,",
      "8": "and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. {Gr. stauros – stake}",
      "9": "Therefore, God also has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name,",
      "10": "that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth,",
      "11": "and that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father.",
      "12": "Therefore, my beloved, as ye have always hearkened, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own saving health with fear and trembling.",
      "13": "For it is God who works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.",
      "14": "Do all things without murmurings and doubts,",
      "15": "that ye may be blameless and innocent, children of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world,",
      "16": "holding fast the word of life, that I may glory in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.",
      "17": "And even if I am poured out as an offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.",
      "18": "For the same cause ye also have joy and rejoice with me.",
      "19": "But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort when I know your state.",
      "20": "For I have no one likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.",
      "21": "For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.",
      "22": "But ye know the proof of him, that as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.",
      "23": "Therefore, I hope to send him presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.",
      "24": "But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.",
      "25": "Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier, but your messenger and he that ministered to my needs.",
      "26": "For he longed after you all and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he had been sick",
      "27": "For indeed he was sick near unto death, but God had mercy on him and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.",
      "28": "I sent him, therefore, the more carefully, that when ye see him again, ye may rejoice and that I may be the less sorrowful.",
      "29": "Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and esteem such",
      "30": "because for the work of the Christ he was near unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me."

      "1": "It remains, my brethren, that ye rejoice in the Lord. It does not bother me to write the same things to you, and for you it is safe.",
      "2": "Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.",
      "3": "For we are the circumcision, who serve God in spirit and glory in Christ Jesus, having no confidence in the flesh.",
      "4": "Though I might also have reason to confide in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:",
      "5": "Circumcised the eighth day, of the lineage of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;",
      "6": "concerning zeal, a persecutor of the congregation; {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.",
      "7": "But those things which were gain to me, I counted loss for Christ.",
      "8": "And doubtless I even count all things as loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ",
      "9": "and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:",
      "10": "That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death,",
      "11": "if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.",
      "12": "Not as though I had already attained it, either were already perfect, but I follow after, if I may lay hold of that for which I have also been laid hold of by the Christ, Jesus.",
      "13": "Brethren, I do not reckon to have laid hold of it yet, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and extending myself unto those things which are ahead,",
      "14": "I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.",
      "15": "Let us, therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded; and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.",
      "16": "Nevertheless, in that unto which we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us have the same mind.",
      "17": "Brethren, be imitators of me and consider those who so walk, as ye have us for a pattern.",
      "18": "(For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} of Christ;",
      "19": "whose end shall be perdition, whose God is their belly and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things).",
      "20": "For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:",
      "21": "Who shall transform our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto the body of his glory, according to the working by which he is also able to subdue all things unto himself."

      "8": "Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, exercise yourselves in these things.",
      "9": "Those things, which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, do, and the God of peace shall be with you.",
      "10": "But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again, in which ye were also concerned, but ye lacked opportunity.",
      "11": "Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content.",
      "12": "I know both how to be humbled, and I know how to have an abundance; in everything and by all things I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.",
