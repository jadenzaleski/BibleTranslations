      "6": "And again, when he brought in the firstbegotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.",
      "7": "And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire.",
      "8": "But unto the Son he said, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a rod of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.",

      "11": "Let us therefore make haste to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.",

      "14": "saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee.",
