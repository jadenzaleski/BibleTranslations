      "3": "Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus, the Christ, who according to his great mercy has begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus, the Christ, from the dead,",
      "4": "unto the incorruptible inheritance that cannot be defiled and that does not fade away, conserved in the heavens for you,",
      "5": "who are kept in the virtue of God by faith, to attain unto the saving health which is made ready to be manifested in the last time.",
      "6": "In which ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are afflicted in diverse temptations,",
      "7": "that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold (which perishes, nevertheless it is tried with fire), might be found unto praise and glory and honour when Jesus, the Christ, is made manifest;",
      "8": "whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though at present ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;",

      "10": "Of which saving health the prophets, (who prophesied of the grace that was to come in you) have enquired and searched diligently;",
      "11": "searching when and in what point of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, which announced beforehand the afflictions that were to come upon the Christ, and the glory that should follow them.",
      "12": "Unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves, but unto us they did administer the things, which are now announced unto you by those that have preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven, which things the angels desire to look into.",
      "13": "Therefore, having the loins of your understanding girded with temperance, wait perfectly in the grace that is presented unto you when Jesus, the Christ, is manifested unto you,",
      "14": "as obedient sons, not conforming yourselves with the former desires that you had before in your ignorance,",

      "18": "knowing that ye have been ransomed from your vain conversation (which you received from your fathers), not with corruptible things like silver and gold,",
      "19": "but with the precious blood of the Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without contamination,",
      "20": "already ordained from before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for love of you,",

      "24": "For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away,",
      "25": "but the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you."

      "6": "Therefore, also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion the chief corner stone, chosen, precious; and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.",
      "7": "Unto you, therefore, who believe he is precious; but unto those who are disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,",
      "8": "and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, even to those who stumble at the word, not obeying in that for which they were ordained.",
      "9": "But ye are the chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, an acquired people, that ye should show forth the virtues of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.",
      "10": "Ye who in the time past were not a people, but are now the people of God, who in the time past had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.",
      "11": "Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from the carnal desires which war against the soul",
      "12": "and have your honest conversation among the Gentiles, so that, in that which they murmur about you as of evildoers, having witnessed your good works, they may glorify God in the day of visitation.",
      "13": "Therefore, be subject to every human ordinance that is of the Lord, whether it be to a king or to a superior,",
      "14": "and unto governors as unto those that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those that do well.",
      "15": "For this is the will of God, that in well doing ye may silence the ignorance of vain men,",
      "16": "as being free, yet not using your liberty to cover maliciousness, but as slaves of God.",
      "17": "Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.",
      "18": "Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and humane, but also to the unjust.",
      "19": "For this is due to grace, if a man for conscience toward God endures grief, suffering wrongfully.",
      "20": "For what glory is it if, when ye are buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is due to grace from God.",
      "21": "Because for this were ye called: for the Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps",
      "22": "who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth,",
      "23": "who, when he was cursed, did not return the curse; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but committed himself to him that judges righteously;",
      "24": "he himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness; by whose wound ye were healed.",

      "3": "Let their adorning not be outward with ostentatious hairdos and wearing of gold nor in composition of apparel,",
      "4": "but let the interior adorning of the heart be without corruption, and of an agreeable spirit and peaceful, which is precious in the sight of God.",
      "5": "For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who waited upon God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands,",
      "6": "as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, of whom ye are made daughters, doing well and not being afraid of any terror.",
      "7": "Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them wisely, giving honour unto the woman, as unto a more fragile vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers not be hindered.",
      "8": "And finally, be ye all of one consent, of one affection, loving each other fraternally, merciful, courteous,",
      "9": "not rendering evil for evil or curse for curse, but to the contrary, blessing, knowing that ye are called, that ye should possess a blessing by inheritance.",
      "10": "For he that desires to love life and see the good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile;",
      "11": "let him separate himself from evil and do good; let him seek peace and follow it.",
      "12": "For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against those that do evil.",
      "13": "And who is he that can harm you, if ye are followers of that which is good?",
      "14": "But also if ye suffer anything for righteousness’ sake, blessed are ye; therefore, be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled,",
      "15": "but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to respond to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and reverence,",
      "16": "having a good conscience, so in that which they murmur against you as of evildoers, those that blaspheme your good conversation in the Christ may be confused.",
      "17": "For it is better (if the will of God so desires) that ye suffer for doing good than for doing evil.",
      "18": "For the Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in spirit,",
      "19": "in which he also went and preached unto the imprisoned spirits,",
      "20": "which in the time past were disobedient, when once the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being made ready, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.",
      "21": "Unto the figure of which the baptism that does now correspond saves us (not taking away the uncleanness of the flesh, but giving testimony of a good conscience before God) by the resurrection of Jesus, the Christ,",
      "22": "who is at the right hand of God, having ascended into heaven, unto whom the angels and the authorities and powers are subject."

      "2": "so that now the time that remains in the flesh, he might live, not unto the lusts of men, but unto the will of God.",
      "3": "For it should suffice us that during the time past of our life we had done the will of the Gentiles, when we conversed in lasciviousness, lusts, drunkenness, gluttony, orgies, and abominable idolatries.",
      "4": "And it seems strange to those that speak evil of you, that ye do not run with them to the same unchecked dissolution;",
      "5": "the same shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.",
      "6": "Because for this cause was the gospel preached also to those that are dead, that they might be judged in flesh according to men, but live in spirit according to God.",
      "7": "But the end of all things is at hand; be ye, therefore, temperate and watch unto prayer.",
      "8": "And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves; for charity shall cover a multitude of sins.",
      "9": "Lovingly be hospitable one to another without murmuring.",
      "10": "Let each one according to the gift that he has received, administer it unto the others, as a good steward of the diverse graces of God.",

      "12": "Beloved, think it not strange when you are tried by fire (which is done to prove you) as though some strange thing happened unto you,",
      "13": "but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of the afflictions of the Christ, so that also in the revelation of his glory, ye may rejoice in triumph.",
      "14": "If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are ye; for the glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you; certainly on their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.",
      "15": "So let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as desirous of the things of others.",
      "16": "But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf.",
      "17": "For it is time that the judgment begins from the house of God; and if it first begins with us, what shall the end be of those that do not obey the gospel of God?",
      "18": "And if the righteous are saved with difficulty, where shall the unfaithful and the sinner appear?",
      "19": "Therefore, let those that are afflicted according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls unto him as unto a faithful Creator, doing good."
