      "3": "He is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact likeness of his being, and he holds everything together by his powerful word. After he had provided a cleansing from sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Highest Majesty",
      "4": "and became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is better than theirs.",
      "5": "For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father”? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son”?",
      "6": "And again, when he brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all God’s angels worship him.”",
      "7": "Now about the angels he says,\n“He makes his angels winds,\nand his servants flames of fire.”",
      "8": "But about the Son he says,\n“Your throne, O God,\n    is forever and ever,\nand the scepter of your kingdom\n    is a righteous scepter.",
      "9": "You have loved righteousness\n    and hated wickedness.\nThat is why God, your God,\n    anointed you rather than your companions\n        with the oil of gladness.”",
      "10": "And,\n“In the beginning, Lord,\n    you laid the foundation of the earth,\n        and the heavens are the work of your hands.",
      "11": "They will come to an end,\n    but you will remain forever.\n        They will all wear out like clothes.",
      "12": "You will roll them up like a robe,\n    and they will be changed like clothes.\nBut you remain the same,\n    and your life will never end.”",
      "13": "But to which of the angels did he ever say,\n“Sit at my right hand\n    until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?",
      "14": "All of them are spirits on a divine mission, sent to serve those who are about to inherit salvation, aren’t they?"

      "1": "For this reason we must pay closer attention to the things we have heard, or we may drift away,",
      "2": "because if the message spoken by angels was reliable, and every violation and act of disobedience received its just punishment,",
      "3": "how will we escape if we neglect a salvation as great as this? It was first proclaimed by the Lord himself, and then it was confirmed to us by those who heard him,",
      "4": "while God added his testimony through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.",
      "5": "For he did not put the coming world we are talking about under the control of angels.",
      "6": "Instead, someone has declared somewhere,\n“What is man that you should remember him,\n    or the son of man that you should care for him?",
      "7": "You made him a little lower than the angels,\n    yet you crowned him with glory and honor",
      "8": "and put everything under his feet.”\nNow when God put everything under him, he left nothing outside his control. However, at the present time we do not yet see everything put under him.",
      "9": "But we do see someone who was made a little lower than the angels. He is Jesus, who is crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might experience death for everyone.",
      "10": "It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering as part of his plan to glorify many children,",
      "11": "because both the one who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified all have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers",
      "12": "when he says, “I will announce your name to my brothers. I will praise you within the congregation.”",
      "13": "And again, “I will trust him.” And again, “I am here with the children God has given me.”",
      "14": "Therefore, since the children have flesh and blood, he himself also shared the same things, so that by his death he might destroy the one who has the power of death (that is, the Devil)",
      "15": "and might free those who were slaves all their lives because they were terrified by death.",
      "16": "For it is clear that he did not come to help angels. No, he came to help Abraham’s descendants,",
      "17": "thereby becoming like his brothers in every way, so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God and could atone for the people’s sins.",
      "18": "Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted."

      "3": "because he is worthy of greater glory than Moses in the same way that the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.",
      "4": "After all, every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.",
      "5": "Moses was faithful in all God’s household as a servant who was to testify to what would be said later,",
      "6": "but the Messiah was faithful as the Son in charge of God’s household, and we are his household if we hold on to our courage and the hope in which we rejoice.",
      "7": "Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,",
      "8": "do not harden your hearts\nas they did when they provoked me\n    during the time of testing in the wilderness.",
      "9": "There your ancestors tested me,\neven though they had seen my actions",
      "10": "for 40 years.\nThat is why I was indignant with that generation and said,\n    ‘They are always going astray in their hearts,\n        and they have not known my ways.’",
      "11": "So in my anger I swore a solemn oath\n    that they would never enter my rest.”",
      "12": "See to it, my brothers, that no evil, unbelieving heart is found in any of you, as shown by your turning away from the living God.",
      "13": "Instead, continue to encourage one another every day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin,",
      "14": "because we are the Messiah’s partners only if we hold on to our original confidence to the end.",
      "15": "As it is said,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\n    do not harden your hearts\n        as they did when they provoked me.”",
      "16": "Now who heard him and provoked him? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?",
      "17": "And with whom was he angry for 40 years? Was it not with those who sinned and whose bodies fell dead in the wilderness?",
      "18": "And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest? It was to those who disobeyed him, was it not?",
      "19": "So we see that they were unable to enter because of their unbelief."

    "4": {
      "1": "Therefore, as long as the promise of entering his rest remains valid, let us be afraid! Otherwise, some of you will fail to reach it,",
      "2": "because we have had the good news told to us as well as to them. But the message they heard did not help them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened to it.",
      "3": "We who have believed are entering that rest, just as he has said,\n“So in my anger I swore a solemn oath\n    that they would never enter my rest,”\neven though his actions had been finished since the creation of the world.",
      "4": "Somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day as follows: “On the seventh day God rested from all his actions,”",
      "5": "and again in this passage, “They will never enter my rest.”",
      "6": "Therefore, since it is still true that some will enter it, and since those who once heard the good news failed to enter it because of their disobedience,",
      "7": "he again fixes a definite day—“Today”—saying long afterward through David, as already quoted,\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\n    do not harden your hearts.”",
      "8": "For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken later about another day.",
      "9": "There remains, therefore, a Sabbath rest for the people of God to keep,",
      "10": "because the one who enters God’s rest has himself rested from his own actions, just as God did from his.",
      "11": "Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fail by following their example of disobedience.",
      "12": "For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, as it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.",
      "13": "No creature can hide from him, but everyone is exposed and helpless before the eyes of the one to whom we must give a word of explanation.",
      "14": "Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone to heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us live our lives consistent with our confession of faith.",
      "15": "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses. Instead, we have one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet he never sinned.",
      "16": "So let us keep on coming boldly to the throne of grace, so that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need."

      "2": "He can deal gently with people who are ignorant and easily deceived, since he himself is subject to weakness.",
      "3": "For that reason he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as for those of the people.",
      "4": "No one takes this honor upon himself but he is called to it by God, just as Aaron was.",
      "5": "In the same way, the Messiah did not take upon himself the glory of being a high priest. No, it was God who said to him,\n“You are my Son.\n    Today I have become your Father.”",
      "6": "As he also says in another place,\n“You are a priest forever\n    according to the order of Melchizedek.”",
      "7": "As a mortal man, he offered up prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his devotion to God.",
      "8": "Son though he was, he learned obedience through his sufferings",
      "9": "and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,",
      "10": "having been designated by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.",
      "11": "We have much to say about this, but it is difficult to explain because you have become too lazy to understand.",
      "12": "In fact, though by now you should be teachers, you still need someone to teach you the basic truths of God’s word. You have become people who need milk instead of solid food.",
      "13": "For everyone who lives on milk is still a baby and does not yet know the difference between right and wrong.",
      "14": "But solid food is for mature people, whose minds are trained by practice to distinguish good from evil."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Therefore, leaving behind the elementary teachings about the Messiah, let us continue to be carried along to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead actions, faith toward God,",
      "2": "instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.",
      "3": "And this we will do, if God permits.",
      "4": "For it is impossible to keep on restoring to repentance time and again people who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have become partners with the Holy Spirit,",
      "5": "who have tasted the goodness of God’s word and the powers of the coming age,",
      "6": "and who have fallen away, as long as they continue to crucify the Son of God to their own detriment by exposing him to public ridicule.",
      "7": "For when the ground soaks up rain that often falls on it and continues producing vegetation useful to those for whom it is cultivated, it receives a blessing from God.",
      "8": "However, if it continues to produce thorns and thistles, it is worthless and in danger of being cursed, and in the end will be burned.",
      "9": "Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case, things that point to salvation.",
      "10": "For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have ministered to the saints and continue to minister to them.",
      "11": "But we want each of you to continue to be diligent to the very end, in order to give full assurance to your hope.",
      "12": "Then, instead of being lazy, you will imitate those who are inheriting the promises through faith and patience.",
      "13": "For when God made his promise to Abraham, he swore an oath by himself, since he had no one greater to swear by.",
      "14": "He said, “I will certainly bless you and give you many descendants.”",
      "15": "And so he obtained what he had been promised, because he patiently waited for it.",
      "16": "For people swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all argument.",
      "17": "In the same way, when God wanted to make the unchangeable character of his purpose perfectly clear to the heirs of his promise, he guaranteed it with an oath,",
      "18": "so that by these two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to prove false, we who have taken refuge in him might be encouraged to seize the hope set before us.",
      "19": "That hope, firm and secure like an anchor for our souls, reaches behind the curtain",
      "20": "where Jesus, our forerunner, has gone on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "Now this man Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, met Abraham and blessed him when he was returning from defeating the kings.",
      "2": "Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything. In the first place, his name means “king of righteousness,” and then he is also king of Salem, that is, “king of peace.”",
      "3": "He has no father, mother, or genealogy, no birth date recorded for him, nor a date of death. Like the Son of God, he continues to be a priest forever.",
      "4": "Just look at how great this man was! Even Abraham—the patriarch himself—gave him a tenth of what he had captured!",
      "5": "The descendants of Levi who accept the priesthood have a commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their own brothers, even though they are also descendants of Abraham.",
      "6": "But this man, whose descent is not traced from them, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the man who had received the promises.",
      "7": "It is beyond dispute that the less important person is blessed by the more important person.",
      "8": "Mortal men collect tithes, but we are informed by Scripture that Melchizedek keeps on living.",
      "9": "One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,",
      "10": "because Levi was still inside his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.",
      "11": "Now if perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—for on this basis the people received the Law—what further need would there be to speak of appointing another kind of priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not one according to the order of Aaron?",
      "12": "When a change in the priesthood takes place, there must also be a change in the Law.",
      "13": "For the person we are talking about belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.",
      "14": "Furthermore, it is obvious that our Lord was a descendant of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests coming from that tribe.",
      "15": "This point is even more obvious in that another priest who is like Melchizedek has appeared",
      "16": "who was appointed to be a priest, not on the basis of a genealogical registry, but rather on the power of an indestructible life.",
      "17": "For it is declared about him,\n“You are a priest forever\n    according to the order of Melchizedek.”",
      "18": "Indeed, because it was weak and ineffective, the former commandment has been annulled,",
      "19": "since the Law made nothing perfect, and a better hope is presented, by which we approach God.",
      "20": "Now none of this happened without an oath. Others became priests without any oath,",
      "21": "but Jesus became a priest with an oath when God told him,\n“The Lord has taken an oath\n    and will not change his mind.\nYou are a priest forever.”",
      "22": "In this way, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.",
      "23": "There have been many priests, since each one of them had to stop serving in office when he died.",
      "24": "But because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.",
      "25": "Therefore, because he always lives to intercede for them, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him.",
      "26": "We need such a high priest—one who is holy, innocent, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.",
      "27": "He has no need to offer sacrifices every day like high priests do, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he sacrificed himself.",
      "28": "For the Law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the promised oath, which came after the Law, results in a Son who is eternally perfect."
    },
    "8": {
      "1": "Now the main point in what we are saying is this: we do have this kind of high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven",
      "2": "and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tent set up by the Lord and not by any human.",
      "3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore, this high priest had to offer something, too.",
      "4": "Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because other men offer the gifts prescribed by the Law.",
      "5": "They serve in a sanctuary that is a copy, a shadow of the heavenly one. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tent: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”",
      "6": "However, Jesus has now obtained a more superior ministry, since the covenant he mediates is founded on better promises.",
      "7": "If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one,",
      "8": "but God found something wrong with his people when he said,\n“Look! The days are coming, declares the Lord,\n    when I will establish a new covenant\n        with the house of Israel\n        and with the house of Judah.",
      "9": "It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors at the time\n    when I took them by the hand\n        and brought them out of the land of Egypt.\nBecause they did not remain loyal to my covenant,\n    I ignored them, declares the Lord.",
      "10": "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel\n    after that time, declares the Lord:\nI will put my laws in their minds\n    and write them on their hearts.\nI will be their God,\n    and they will be my people.",
      "11": "Never again will everyone teach his neighbor\n    or his brother by saying, ‘Know the Lord,’\nbecause all of them will know me,\n    from the least important to the most important.",

      "1": "Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.",
      "2": "For a tent was set up, and in the first part were the lamp stand, the table, and the bread of the Presence. This was called the Holy Place.",
      "3": "Behind the second curtain was the part of the tent called the Most Holy Place,",
      "4": "which had the gold altar for incense and the Ark of the Covenant completely covered with gold. In it were the gold jar holding the manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the Tablets of the Covenant.",
      "5": "Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of atonement. (We cannot discuss these things in detail now.)",
      "6": "When everything had been arranged like this, the priests always went into the first part of the tent to perform their duties.",
      "7": "But only the high priest went into the second part, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins committed by the people in ignorance.",
      "8": "The Holy Spirit was indicating by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first part of the tent was still standing.",
      "9": "This illustration for today indicates that the gifts and sacrifices being offered could not clear the conscience of a worshiper,",
      "10": "since they deal only with food, drink, and various washings, which are required for the body until the time when things would be set right.",
      "11": "But when the Messiah came as a high priest of the good things that have come, he went through the greater and more perfect tent that was not made by human hands and that is not a part of this creation.",
      "12": "Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood he went into the Most Holy Place once for all and secured our eternal redemption.",
      "13": "For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are unclean purifies them physically,",
      "14": "how much more will the blood of the Messiah, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from dead actions so that we may serve the living God!",
      "15": "This is why the Messiah is the mediator of a new covenant; so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance promised them, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the offenses committed under the first covenant.",
      "16": "For where there is a will, the death of the one who made it must be established.",
      "17": "For a will is in force only when somebody has died, since it never takes effect as long as the one who made it is alive.",
      "18": "This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.",
      "19": "For after every commandment in the Law had been spoken to all the people by Moses, he took the blood of calves and goats, together with some water, scarlet wool, and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people,",
      "20": "saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God ordained for you.”",
      "21": "In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and everything used in worship.",
      "22": "In fact, under the Law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of the blood there is no forgiveness.",
      "23": "Thus it was necessary for these earthly copies of the things in heaven to be cleansed by these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves are made clean with better sacrifices than these.",
      "24": "For the Messiah did not go into a sanctuary made by human hands that is merely a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, to appear now in God’s presence on our behalf.",
      "25": "Nor did he go into heaven to sacrifice himself again and again, the way the high priest goes into the Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.",
      "26": "Then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the creation of the world. But now, at the end of the ages, he has appeared once for all to remove sin by his sacrifice.",
      "27": "Indeed, just as people are destined to die once and after that to be judged,",
      "28": "so the Messiah was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people. And he will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly wait for him."

      "3": "Instead, through those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year,",

      "13": "Since that time, he has been waiting for his enemies to be made a footstool for his feet.",
      "14": "For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.",

      "23": "Let us continue to hold firmly to the hope that we confess without wavering, for the one who made the promise is faithful.",
      "24": "And let us continue to consider how to motivate one another to love and good deeds,",
      "25": "not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another even more as you see the day of the Lord coming nearer.",
      "26": "For if we choose to go on sinning after we have learned the full truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,",
      "27": "but only a terrifying prospect of judgment and a raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.",
      "28": "Anyone who violates the Law of Moses dies without mercy “on the testimony of two or three witnesses.”",
