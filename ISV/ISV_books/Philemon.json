      "1": "From: Paul, a prisoner of the Messiah Jesus, and Timothy our brother.\nTo: Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,",
      "2": "to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house.",
      "3": "May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours!",
      "4": "I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,",
      "5": "because I keep hearing about your love for all the saints and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus.",
      "6": "I pray that your partnership in the faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every blessing that is ours in the Messiah.",
      "7": "For I have received considerable joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed, brother, through you.",
      "8": "For this reason, although in the Messiah I have complete freedom to order you to do what is proper,",
      "9": "I prefer to make my appeal on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an old man and now a prisoner of the Messiah Jesus,",
      "10": "appeal to you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment.",
      "11": "Once he was useless to you, but now he is very useful both to you and to me.",
      "12": "As I send him back, it’s like I’m coming along with him.",
      "13": "I wanted to keep him with me so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel.",
      "14": "Yet I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be something forced, but voluntary.",
      "15": "Perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you could have him back forever,",
      "16": "no longer as a slave but better than a slave—as a dear brother, especially to me, but even more so to you, both as a person and as a believer.",
      "17": "So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.",
      "18": "If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account.",
      "19": "I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. (I will not mention to you that you owe me your very life.)",
      "20": "Yes, brother, I desire this favor from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Messiah!",
      "21": "Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you because I know that you will do even more than I ask.",
      "22": "Meanwhile, prepare a guest room for me, too, for I am hoping through your prayers to be returned to you.",
      "23": "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in the Messiah Jesus, sends you greetings,",
      "24": "as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.",
      "25": "May the grace of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be with your spirit! Amen."
