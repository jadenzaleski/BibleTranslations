      "3": "How blessed is the one who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy and obey what is written in it, for the time is near!",
      "4": "From John to the seven churches in Asia. May grace and peace be yours from the one who is, who was, and who is coming, from the seven spirits who are in front of his throne,",
      "5": "and from Jesus the Messiah, the witness, the faithful one, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood",

      "7": "Look! He is coming in the clouds.\n    Every eye will see him,\n        even those who pierced him,\nand all the tribes of the earth will mourn\n    because of him.\nSo be it! Amen.",

      "9": "I am John, your brother and partner in the oppression, kingdom, and patience that comes because of Jesus. I was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.",
      "10": "I came to be in the Spirit on the Day of the Lord, when I heard a loud voice behind me like a trumpet,",
      "11": "saying, “Write on a scroll what you see, and send it to the seven churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”",
      "12": "Then I turned to see who was talking to me, and when I turned I saw seven gold lamp stands.",
      "13": "Among the lamp stands there was someone like the Son of Man. He was wearing a long robe with a gold sash around his chest.",
      "14": "His head and his hair were white like wool, in fact, as white as snow. His eyes were like flames of fire,",
      "15": "his feet were like glowing bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of raging waters.",
      "16": "In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword. His face was like the sun when it shines with full force.",
      "17": "When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. But he placed his right hand on me and said, “Stop being afraid! I am the first and the last,",
      "18": "the living one. I was dead—but look!—I am alive forever and ever! I have the keys of Death and Hades.",
      "19": "Therefore, write down what you have seen, what is, and what is going to happen after this.",
      "20": "The secret meaning of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lamp stands is this: the seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lamp stands are the seven churches.”"

      "2": "‘I know what you’ve been doing, your toil, and your endurance. I also know that you cannot tolerate evil people. You have tested those who call themselves apostles, but are not, and have found them to be false.",
      "3": "You have endured and suffered because of my name, yet you have not grown weary.",
      "4": "However, I have this against you: You have abandoned the love you had at first.",
      "5": "Therefore, remember how far you have fallen. Repent and go back to what you were doing at first. If you don’t, I will come to you and remove your lamp stand from its place—unless you repent.",
      "6": "But this is to your credit: You hate the actions of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.",
      "7": "‘Let everyone listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the privilege of eating from the tree of life that is in God’s paradise to everyone who overcomes.’”",

      "10": "Don’t be afraid of what you are going to suffer. Look! The Devil is going to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested. For ten days you will undergo suffering. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the victor’s crown of life.",
      "11": "‘Let everyone listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who overcomes will never be hurt by the second death.’”",

      "14": "But I have a few things against you: You have there some who hold to the teaching of Balaam, the one who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the people of Israel so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and practice immorality.",
      "15": "You also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.",
      "16": "So repent. If you don’t, I will come to you quickly and wage war against them with the sword of my mouth.",
      "17": "‘Let everyone listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give some of the hidden manna to everyone who overcomes.’” I will also give him a white stone. On the white stone is written a new name that no one knows except the person who receives it.’”",
      "18": "“To the messenger of the church in Thyatira, write:\n‘The Son of God, whose eyes are like flaming fire and whose feet are like glowing bronze, says this:",
      "19": "‘I know what you’ve been doing—your love, faithfulness, service, and endurance—and that your last actions are greater than the first.",
      "20": "But I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet and who teaches and leads my servants to practice immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.",
      "21": "I gave her time to repent, but she refused to repent of her immorality.",
      "22": "Look! I am going to strike her with illness. Those who commit adultery with her will also suffer greatly, unless they repent from acting like her.",
      "23": "I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts. I will reward each of you as your actions deserve.",
      "24": "‘But as for the rest of you in Thyatira—you who do not hold to this teaching and who have not learned what some people call the deep things of Satan—I won’t burden you with anything else.",
      "25": "Just hold on to what you have until I come.",
      "26": "I will give authority over the nations to the person who overcomes and continues to do what I’ve commanded to the end, and",
      "27": "‘He will rule them with an iron scepter;\n    shattering them like clay pots.’",
      "28": "‘Just as I have received authority from my Father, I will also give him the morning star.",

      "8": "‘I know what you’ve been doing. Look! I have put in front of you an open door that no one can shut. You have only a little strength, but you have obeyed my word and have not denied my name.",

      "3": "No one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth could open the scroll or look inside it.",
      "4": "I began to cry bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it.",

      "14": "Then the four living creatures said, “Amen!”, and the elders bowed down and worshipped."

      "1": "Then I saw the lamb open the first of the seven seals. I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Go!”",

      "3": "When the lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Go!”",
      "4": "A second horse went out. It was fiery red, and its rider was given permission to take peace away from the earth and to make people slaughter one another. So he was given a large sword.",

      "6": "I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures, saying, “One day’s ration of wheat for a day’s wage, or three day’s ration of barley for a day’s wage! But don’t damage the olive oil or the wine!”",
      "7": "When the lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Go!”",
      "8": "I looked, and there was a pale green horse! Its rider’s name was Death, and Hades followed him. They were given authority over one-fourth of the earth to kill people using wars, famines, plagues, and the wild animals of the earth.",
      "9": "When the lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and the testimony they had given.",
      "10": "They cried out in a loud voice,\n“Holy and true Sovereign,\n    how long will it be before you judge\nand take revenge on those living on the earth\n    who shed our blood?”",
      "11": "Each of them was given a white robe. They were told to rest a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers was completed, who would be killed as they themselves had been.",
      "12": "Then I saw the lamb open the sixth seal. There was a powerful earthquake. The sun turned as black as sackcloth made of hair, and the full moon turned as red as blood.",
      "13": "The stars in the sky fell to the earth like a fig tree drops its fruit when it is shaken by a strong wind.",
      "14": "The sky vanished like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.",
      "15": "Then the kings of the earth, the important people, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and all the slaves and free people concealed themselves in caves and among the rocks in the mountains.",
      "16": "They told the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb.",

      "3": "“Don’t harm the land, the sea, or the trees until we have marked the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.”",

      "9": "After these things, I looked, and there was a crowd so large that no one was able to count it! They were from every nation, tribe, people, and language. They were standing in front of the throne and the lamb and were wearing white robes, with palm branches in their hands.",
      "10": "They cried out in a loud voice,\n“Salvation belongs to our God,\n    who sits on the throne,\n        and to the lamb!”",
      "11": "All the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell on their faces in front of the throne and worshipped God,",

      "13": "“Who are these people wearing white robes,” one of the elders asked me, “and where did they come from?”",
      "14": "I told him, “Sir, you know.”\nThen he told me, “These are the people who are coming out of the terrible suffering. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.",
