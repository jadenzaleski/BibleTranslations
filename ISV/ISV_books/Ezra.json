      "22": "because I was ashamed to ask the king for a contingent of soldiers and cavalry to protect us from enemies we might encounter on the way. After all, we had told the king, “The hand of our God seeks the good of all who seek him, but his power and anger are against everyone who forsakes him.”",

      "30": "So the priests and descendants of Levi took possession of the silver, the gold, and the vessels in order to bring them to Jerusalem, to the Temple of our God.",
      "31": "Then we left the Ahava River for Jerusalem on the twelfth day of the first month. Our God’s protection was with us, and he delivered us from the enemy’s power and from ambush along the way.",

      "33": "On the fourth day the silver, the gold, and the vessels were distributed at the Temple of our God into the care of Uriah’s son Meremoth the priest, Phinehas’ son Eleazar, Jeshua’s son Jozabad, and Binnui’s son Noadiah, the descendants of Levi.",
      "34": "Distribution was according to inventory and weight, with all weights being recorded at that time.",
      "35": "The descendants of those who had been taken into captivity and who had returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all of Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering—all of them burnt offerings to the Lord.",
      "36": "Then they delivered copies of the king’s orders to the king’s officers, and governors on this side of the Euphrates River. The orders were in support of the people and God’s Temple."

      "11": "that you gave in the writings of your servants, the prophets:\n‘The land you are entering to possess is a morally unclean land due to the moral uncleanness of the people who live in there—along with their abominations—that has filled it from one end to the other with their impurities.",
      "12": "So, therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor marry their daughters to your sons, and under no circumstances are you to seek their well-being or their wealth, so that you may remain strong, enjoying the best things the land has to give, and so that you may establish an inheritance for your children forever.’",
