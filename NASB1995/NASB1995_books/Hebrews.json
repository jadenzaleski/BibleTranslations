      "6": "And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says,\n“And let all the angels of God worship Him.”",

      "7": "“You have made him for a little while lower than the angels;\nYou have crowned him with glory and honor,\nAnd have appointed him over the works of Your hands;",

      "9": "But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way.",

      "12": "so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.",

      "14": "saying, “I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you.”",

      "13": "For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.",
