      "1": "The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah:",
      "2": "“I will completely remove all things\nFrom the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.",
      "3": "“I will remove man and beast;\nI will remove the birds of the sky\nAnd the fish of the sea,\nAnd the ruins along with the wicked;\nAnd I will cut off man from the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.",
      "4": "“So I will stretch out My hand against Judah\nAnd against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\nAnd I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place,\nAnd the names of the idolatrous priests along with the priests.",
      "5": "“And those who bow down on the housetops to the host of heaven,\nAnd those who bow down and swear to the Lord and yet swear by Milcom,",
      "6": "And those who have turned back from following the Lord,\nAnd those who have not sought the Lord or inquired of Him.”",
      "7": "Be silent before the Lord God!\nFor the day of the Lord is near,\nFor the Lord has prepared a sacrifice,\nHe has consecrated His guests.",
      "8": "“Then it will come about on the day of the Lord’s sacrifice\nThat I will punish the princes, the king’s sons\nAnd all who clothe themselves with foreign garments.",
      "9": "“And I will punish on that day all who leap on the temple threshold,\nWho fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.",
      "10": "“On that day,” declares the Lord,\n“There will be the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate,\nA wail from the Second Quarter,\nAnd a loud crash from the hills.",
      "11": "“Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar,\nFor all the people of Canaan will be silenced;\nAll who weigh out silver will be cut off.",
      "12": "“It will come about at that time\nThat I will search Jerusalem with lamps,\nAnd I will punish the men\nWho are stagnant in spirit,\nWho say in their hearts,\n‘The Lord will not do good or evil!’",
      "13": "“Moreover, their wealth will become plunder\nAnd their houses desolate;\nYes, they will build houses but not inhabit them,\nAnd plant vineyards but not drink their wine.”",
      "14": "Near is the great day of the Lord,\nNear and coming very quickly;\nListen, the day of the Lord!\nIn it the warrior cries out bitterly.",
      "15": "A day of wrath is that day,\nA day of trouble and distress,\nA day of destruction and desolation,\nA day of darkness and gloom,\nA day of clouds and thick darkness,",
      "16": "A day of trumpet and battle cry\nAgainst the fortified cities\nAnd the high corner towers.",
      "17": "I will bring distress on men\nSo that they will walk like the blind,\nBecause they have sinned against the Lord;\nAnd their blood will be poured out like dust\nAnd their flesh like dung.",
      "18": "Neither their silver nor their gold\nWill be able to deliver them\nOn the day of the Lord’s wrath;\nAnd all the earth will be devoured\nIn the fire of His jealousy,\nFor He will make a complete end,\nIndeed a terrifying one,\nOf all the inhabitants of the earth."

      "1": "Gather yourselves together, yes, gather,\nO nation without shame,",
      "2": "Before the decree takes effect—\nThe day passes like the chaff—\nBefore the burning anger of the Lord comes upon you,\nBefore the day of the Lord’s anger comes upon you.",
      "3": "Seek the Lord,\nAll you humble of the earth\nWho have carried out His ordinances;\nSeek righteousness, seek humility.\nPerhaps you will be hidden\nIn the day of the Lord’s anger.",
      "4": "For Gaza will be abandoned\nAnd Ashkelon a desolation;\nAshdod will be driven out at noon\nAnd Ekron will be uprooted.",
      "5": "Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast,\nThe nation of the Cherethites!\nThe word of the Lord is against you,\nO Canaan, land of the Philistines;\nAnd I will destroy you\nSo that there will be no inhabitant.",
      "6": "So the seacoast will be pastures,\nWith caves for shepherds and folds for flocks.",
      "7": "And the coast will be\nFor the remnant of the house of Judah,\nThey will pasture on it.\nIn the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening;\nFor the Lord their God will care for them\nAnd restore their fortune.",
      "8": "“I have heard the taunting of Moab\nAnd the revilings of the sons of Ammon,\nWith which they have taunted My people\nAnd become arrogant against their territory.",
      "9": "“Therefore, as I live,” declares the Lord of hosts,\nThe God of Israel,\n“Surely Moab will be like Sodom\nAnd the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah—\nA place possessed by nettles and salt pits,\nAnd a perpetual desolation.\nThe remnant of My people will plunder them\nAnd the remainder of My nation will inherit them.”",
      "10": "This they will have in return for their pride, because they have taunted and become arrogant against the people of the Lord of hosts.",
      "11": "The Lord will be terrifying to them, for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him, everyone from his own place.",
      "12": "“You also, O Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword.”",
      "13": "And He will stretch out His hand against the north\nAnd destroy Assyria,\nAnd He will make Nineveh a desolation,\nParched like the wilderness.",
      "14": "Flocks will lie down in her midst,\nAll beasts which range in herds;\nBoth the pelican and the hedgehog\nWill lodge in the tops of her pillars;\nBirds will sing in the window,\nDesolation will be on the threshold;\nFor He has laid bare the cedar work.",
      "15": "This is the exultant city\nWhich dwells securely,\nWho says in her heart,\n“I am, and there is no one besides me.”\nHow she has become a desolation,\nA resting place for beasts!\nEveryone who passes by her will hiss\nAnd wave his hand in contempt."

      "1": "Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled,\nThe tyrannical city!",
      "2": "She heeded no voice,\nShe accepted no instruction.\nShe did not trust in the Lord,\nShe did not draw near to her God.",
      "3": "Her princes within her are roaring lions,\nHer judges are wolves at evening;\nThey leave nothing for the morning.",
      "4": "Her prophets are reckless, treacherous men;\nHer priests have profaned the sanctuary.\nThey have done violence to the law.",
      "5": "The Lord is righteous within her;\nHe will do no injustice.\nEvery morning He brings His justice to light;\nHe does not fail.\nBut the unjust knows no shame.",
      "6": "“I have cut off nations;\nTheir corner towers are in ruins.\nI have made their streets desolate,\nWith no one passing by;\nTheir cities are laid waste,\nWithout a man, without an inhabitant.",
      "7": "“I said, ‘Surely you will revere Me,\nAccept instruction.’\nSo her dwelling will not be cut off\nAccording to all that I have appointed concerning her.\nBut they were eager to corrupt all their deeds.",
      "8": "“Therefore wait for Me,” declares the Lord,\n“For the day when I rise up as a witness.\nIndeed, My decision is to gather nations,\nTo assemble kingdoms,\nTo pour out on them My indignation,\nAll My burning anger;\nFor all the earth will be devoured\nBy the fire of My zeal.",
      "9": "“For then I will give to the peoples purified lips,\nThat all of them may call on the name of the Lord,\nTo serve Him shoulder to shoulder.",
      "10": "“From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia\nMy worshipers, My dispersed ones,\nWill bring My offerings.",
      "11": "“In that day you will feel no shame\nBecause of all your deeds\nBy which you have rebelled against Me;\nFor then I will remove from your midst\nYour proud, exulting ones,\nAnd you will never again be haughty\nOn My holy mountain.",
      "12": "“But I will leave among you\nA humble and lowly people,\nAnd they will take refuge in the name of the Lord.",
      "13": "“The remnant of Israel will do no wrong\nAnd tell no lies,\nNor will a deceitful tongue\nBe found in their mouths;\nFor they will feed and lie down\nWith no one to make them tremble.”",
      "14": "Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion!\nShout in triumph, O Israel!\nRejoice and exult with all your heart,\nO daughter of Jerusalem!",

      "19": "“Behold, I am going to deal at that time\nWith all your oppressors,\nI will save the lame\nAnd gather the outcast,\nAnd I will turn their shame into praise and renown\nIn all the earth.",
      "20": "“At that time I will bring you in,\nEven at the time when I gather you together;\nIndeed, I will give you renown and praise\nAmong all the peoples of the earth,\nWhen I restore your fortunes before your eyes,”\nSays the Lord."
