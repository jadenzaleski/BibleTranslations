      "1": "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.",
      "2": "He was in the beginning with God.",
      "3": "All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.",
      "4": "In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men.",
      "5": "The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.",
      "6": "There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.",
      "7": "He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him.",
      "8": "He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.",
      "9": "There was the true Light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.",
      "10": "He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.",
      "11": "He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him.",
      "12": "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,",
      "13": "who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.",
      "14": "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.",
      "15": "John testified about Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’”",
      "16": "For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.",
      "17": "For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.",
      "18": "No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.",
      "19": "This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”",
      "20": "And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”",
      "21": "They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”",
      "22": "Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”",
      "23": "He said, “I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.”",
      "24": "Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.",
      "25": "They asked him, and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”",
      "26": "John answered them saying, “I baptize in water, but among you stands One whom you do not know.",
      "27": "It is He who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”",
      "28": "These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",
      "29": "The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!",
      "30": "This is He on behalf of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’",
      "31": "I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water.”",
      "32": "John testified saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him.",
      "33": "I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’",
      "34": "I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.”",
      "35": "Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,",
      "36": "and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”",
      "37": "The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.",
      "38": "And Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, “What do you seek?” They said to Him, “Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?”",
      "39": "He said to them, “Come, and you will see.” So they came and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.",
      "40": "One of the two who heard John speak and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.",
      "41": "He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which translated means Christ).",
      "42": "He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).",
      "43": "The next day He purposed to go into Galilee, and He found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow Me.”",
      "44": "Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.",
      "45": "Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”",
      "46": "Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”",
      "47": "Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!”",
      "48": "Nathanael said to Him, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”",
      "49": "Nathanael answered Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.”",
      "50": "Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”",
      "51": "And He said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”"

      "1": "On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;",
      "2": "and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.",
      "3": "When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “They have no wine.”",
      "4": "And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does that have to do with us? My hour has not yet come.”",
      "5": "His mother said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do it.”",
      "6": "Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each.",
      "7": "Jesus said to them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.",
      "8": "And He said to them, “Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.” So they took it to him.",
      "9": "When the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter called the bridegroom,",
      "10": "and said to him, “Every man serves the good wine first, and when the people have drunk freely, then he serves the poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.”",
      "11": "This beginning of His signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.",
      "12": "After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.",
      "13": "The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "14": "And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables.",
      "15": "And He made a scourge of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables;",
      "16": "and to those who were selling the doves He said, “Take these things away; stop making My Father’s house a place of business.”",
      "17": "His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for Your house will consume me.”",
      "18": "The Jews then said to Him, “What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things?”",
      "19": "Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”",
      "20": "The Jews then said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?”",
      "21": "But He was speaking of the temple of His body.",
      "22": "So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.",
      "23": "Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing His signs which He was doing.",
      "24": "But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men,",
      "25": "and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man."

    "3": {
      "1": "Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;",
      "2": "this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.”",
      "3": "Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”",
      "4": "Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?”",
      "5": "Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.",
      "6": "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
      "7": "Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’",
      "8": "The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”",
      "9": "Nicodemus said to Him, “How can these things be?”",
      "10": "Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things?",
      "11": "Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony.",
      "12": "If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?",
      "13": "No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended from heaven: the Son of Man.",
      "14": "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up;",
      "15": "so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.",
      "16": "“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.",
      "17": "For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.",
      "18": "He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.",
      "19": "This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil.",
      "20": "For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.",
      "21": "But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God.”",
      "22": "After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He was spending time with them and baptizing.",
      "23": "John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people were coming and were being baptized—",
      "24": "for John had not yet been thrown into prison.",
      "25": "Therefore there arose a discussion on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purification.",
      "26": "And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.”",
      "27": "John answered and said, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.",
      "28": "You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent ahead of Him.’",
      "29": "He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine has been made full.",
      "30": "He must increase, but I must decrease.",
      "31": "“He who comes from above is above all, he who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.",
      "32": "What He has seen and heard, of that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.",
      "33": "He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.",
      "34": "For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He gives the Spirit without measure.",
      "35": "The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.",
      "36": "He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”"

      "4": "And He had to pass through Samaria.",
      "5": "So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph;",
      "6": "and Jacob’s well was there. So Jesus, being wearied from His journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
      "7": "There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.”",
      "8": "For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.",
      "9": "Therefore the Samaritan woman said to Him, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)",
      "10": "Jesus answered and said to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”",
      "11": "She said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep; where then do You get that living water?",
      "12": "You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle?”",
      "13": "Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again;",
      "14": "but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”",
      "15": "The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water, so I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw.”",
      "16": "He said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.”",
      "17": "The woman answered and said, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have correctly said, ‘I have no husband’;",
      "18": "for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.”",
      "19": "The woman said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.",
      "20": "Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.”",
      "21": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.",
      "22": "You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.",
      "23": "But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.",
      "24": "God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”",
      "25": "The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us.”",

      "27": "At this point His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, “What do You seek?” or, “Why do You speak with her?”",
      "28": "So the woman left her waterpot, and went into the city and said to the men,",
      "29": "“Come, see a man who told me all the things that I have done; this is not the Christ, is it?”",
      "30": "They went out of the city, and were coming to Him.",
      "31": "Meanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”",
      "32": "But He said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”",
      "33": "So the disciples were saying to one another, “No one brought Him anything to eat, did he?”",
      "34": "Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work.",
      "35": "Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest.",
      "36": "Already he who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for life eternal; so that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.",
      "37": "For in this case the saying is true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’",
      "38": "I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored and you have entered into their labor.”",
      "39": "From that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me all the things that I have done.”",
      "40": "So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.",
      "41": "Many more believed because of His word;",

      "43": "After the two days He went forth from there into Galilee.",
      "44": "For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.",
      "45": "So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast.",
      "46": "Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.",
      "47": "When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and was imploring Him to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.",
      "48": "So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you simply will not believe.”",
      "49": "The royal official said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”",
      "50": "Jesus said to him, “Go; your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started off.",
      "51": "As he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that his son was living.",
      "52": "So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”",
      "53": "So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, “Your son lives”; and he himself believed and his whole household.",

      "3": "In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, [waiting for the moving of the waters;",
      "4": "for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was made well from whatever disease with which he was afflicted.]",
      "5": "A man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.",
      "6": "When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, “Do you wish to get well?”",
      "7": "The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.”",

      "13": "But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in that place.",
      "14": "Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.”",
      "15": "The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.",
      "16": "For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.",
      "17": "But He answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working.”",
      "18": "For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.",
      "19": "Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner.",
      "20": "For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will marvel.",
      "21": "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.",
