      "4": "for giving prudence to those who are simple,\n    knowledge and discretion to the young—",
      "5": "let the wise listen and add to their learning,\n    and let the discerning get guidance—",
      "6": "for understanding proverbs and parables,\n    the sayings and riddles of the wise.",
      "7": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,\n    but fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
      "8": "Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction\n    and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.",
      "9": "They are a garland to grace your head\n    and a chain to adorn your neck.",
      "10": "My son, if sinful men entice you,\n    do not give in to them.",
      "11": "If they say, “Come along with us;\n    let’s lie in wait for innocent blood,\n    let’s ambush some harmless soul;",
      "12": "let’s swallow them alive, like the grave,\n    and whole, like those who go down to the pit;",
      "13": "we will get all sorts of valuable things\n    and fill our houses with plunder;",
      "14": "cast lots with us;\n    we will all share the loot”—",
      "15": "my son, do not go along with them,\n    do not set foot on their paths;",
      "16": "for their feet rush into evil,\n    they are swift to shed blood.",
      "17": "How useless to spread a net\n    where every bird can see it!",
      "18": "These men lie in wait for their own blood;\n    they ambush only themselves!",
      "19": "Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain;\n    it takes away the life of those who get it.",
      "20": "Out in the open wisdom calls aloud,\n    she raises her voice in the public square;",
      "21": "on top of the wall she cries out,\n    at the city gate she makes her speech:",
      "22": "“How long will you who are simple love your simple ways?\n    How long will mockers delight in mockery\n    and fools hate knowledge?",
      "23": "Repent at my rebuke!\n    Then I will pour out my thoughts to you,\n    I will make known to you my teachings.",
      "24": "But since you refuse to listen when I call\n    and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,",
      "25": "since you disregard all my advice\n    and do not accept my rebuke,",
      "26": "I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you;\n    I will mock when calamity overtakes you—",
      "27": "when calamity overtakes you like a storm,\n    when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,\n    when distress and trouble overwhelm you.",
      "28": "“Then they will call to me but I will not answer;\n    they will look for me but will not find me,",

      "30": "Since they would not accept my advice\n    and spurned my rebuke,",
      "31": "they will eat the fruit of their ways\n    and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.",
      "32": "For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,\n    and the complacency of fools will destroy them;",

      "17": "who has left the partner of her youth\n    and ignored the covenant she made before God.",
      "18": "Surely her house leads down to death\n    and her paths to the spirits of the dead.",
      "19": "None who go to her return\n    or attain the paths of life.",
      "20": "Thus you will walk in the ways of the good\n    and keep to the paths of the righteous.",
