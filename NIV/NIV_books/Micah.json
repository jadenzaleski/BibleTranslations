      "1": "The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Hear, you peoples, all of you,\n    listen, earth and all who live in it,\nthat the Sovereign Lord may bear witness against you,\n    the Lord from his holy temple.",
      "3": "Look! The Lord is coming from his dwelling place;\n    he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth.",
      "4": "The mountains melt beneath him\n    and the valleys split apart,\nlike wax before the fire,\n    like water rushing down a slope.",
      "5": "All this is because of Jacob’s transgression,\n    because of the sins of the people of Israel.\nWhat is Jacob’s transgression?\n    Is it not Samaria?\nWhat is Judah’s high place?\n    Is it not Jerusalem?",
      "6": "“Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble,\n    a place for planting vineyards.\nI will pour her stones into the valley\n    and lay bare her foundations.",
      "7": "All her idols will be broken to pieces;\n    all her temple gifts will be burned with fire;\n    I will destroy all her images.\nSince she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes,\n    as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used.”",
      "8": "Because of this I will weep and wail;\n    I will go about barefoot and naked.\nI will howl like a jackal\n    and moan like an owl.",
      "9": "For Samaria’s plague is incurable;\n    it has spread to Judah.\nIt has reached the very gate of my people,\n    even to Jerusalem itself.",
      "10": "Tell it not in Gath;\n    weep not at all.\nIn Beth Ophrah\n    roll in the dust.",
      "11": "Pass by naked and in shame,\n    you who live in Shaphir.\nThose who live in Zaanan\n    will not come out.\nBeth Ezel is in mourning;\n    it no longer protects you.",
      "12": "Those who live in Maroth writhe in pain,\n    waiting for relief,\nbecause disaster has come from the Lord,\n    even to the gate of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "You who live in Lachish,\n    harness fast horses to the chariot.\nYou are where the sin of Daughter Zion began,\n    for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.",
      "14": "Therefore you will give parting gifts\n    to Moresheth Gath.\nThe town of Akzib will prove deceptive\n    to the kings of Israel.",
      "15": "I will bring a conqueror against you\n    who live in Mareshah.\nThe nobles of Israel\n    will flee to Adullam.",
      "16": "Shave your head in mourning\n    for the children in whom you delight;\nmake yourself as bald as the vulture,\n    for they will go from you into exile."

      "3": "Therefore, the Lord says:\n“I am planning disaster against this people,\n    from which you cannot save yourselves.\nYou will no longer walk proudly,\n    for it will be a time of calamity.",
      "4": "In that day people will ridicule you;\n    they will taunt you with this mournful song:\n‘We are utterly ruined;\n    my people’s possession is divided up.\nHe takes it from me!\n    He assigns our fields to traitors.’”",
      "5": "Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the Lord\n    to divide the land by lot.",
      "6": "“Do not prophesy,” their prophets say.\n    “Do not prophesy about these things;\n    disgrace will not overtake us.”",
      "7": "You descendants of Jacob, should it be said,\n    “Does the Lord become impatient?\n    Does he do such things?”\n“Do not my words do good\n    to the one whose ways are upright?",
      "8": "Lately my people have risen up\n    like an enemy.\nYou strip off the rich robe\n    from those who pass by without a care,\n    like men returning from battle.",
      "9": "You drive the women of my people\n    from their pleasant homes.\nYou take away my blessing\n    from their children forever.",
      "10": "Get up, go away!\n    For this is not your resting place,\nbecause it is defiled,\n    it is ruined, beyond all remedy.",
      "11": "If a liar and deceiver comes and says,\n    ‘I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,’\n    that would be just the prophet for this people!",
      "12": "“I will surely gather all of you, Jacob;\n    I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel.\nI will bring them together like sheep in a pen,\n    like a flock in its pasture;\n    the place will throng with people.",
      "13": "The One who breaks open the way will go up before them;\n    they will break through the gate and go out.\nTheir King will pass through before them,\n    the Lord at their head.”"

      "3": "who eat my people’s flesh,\n    strip off their skin\n    and break their bones in pieces;\nwho chop them up like meat for the pan,\n    like flesh for the pot?”",
      "4": "Then they will cry out to the Lord,\n    but he will not answer them.\nAt that time he will hide his face from them\n    because of the evil they have done.",
      "5": "This is what the Lord says:\n“As for the prophets\n    who lead my people astray,\nthey proclaim ‘peace’\n    if they have something to eat,\nbut prepare to wage war against anyone\n    who refuses to feed them.",
      "6": "Therefore night will come over you, without visions,\n    and darkness, without divination.\nThe sun will set for the prophets,\n    and the day will go dark for them.",
      "7": "The seers will be ashamed\n    and the diviners disgraced.\nThey will all cover their faces\n    because there is no answer from God.”",
      "8": "But as for me, I am filled with power,\n    with the Spirit of the Lord,\n    and with justice and might,\nto declare to Jacob his transgression,\n    to Israel his sin.",
      "9": "Hear this, you leaders of Jacob,\n    you rulers of Israel,\nwho despise justice\n    and distort all that is right;",
      "10": "who build Zion with bloodshed,\n    and Jerusalem with wickedness.",
      "11": "Her leaders judge for a bribe,\n    her priests teach for a price,\n    and her prophets tell fortunes for money.\nYet they look for the Lord’s support and say,\n    “Is not the Lord among us?\n    No disaster will come upon us.”",
      "12": "Therefore because of you,\n    Zion will be plowed like a field,\nJerusalem will become a heap of rubble,\n    the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets."

      "8": "As for you, watchtower of the flock,\n    stronghold of Daughter Zion,\nthe former dominion will be restored to you;\n    kingship will come to Daughter Jerusalem.”",
      "9": "Why do you now cry aloud—\n    have you no king?\nHas your ruler perished,\n    that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor?",
      "10": "Writhe in agony, Daughter Zion,\n    like a woman in labor,\nfor now you must leave the city\n    to camp in the open field.\nYou will go to Babylon;\n    there you will be rescued.\nThere the Lord will redeem you\n    out of the hand of your enemies.",
