      "6": "The wind blows to the south\n    and turns to the north;\nround and round it goes,\n    ever returning on its course.",
      "7": "All streams flow into the sea,\n    yet the sea is never full.\nTo the place the streams come from,\n    there they return again.",
      "8": "All things are wearisome,\n    more than one can say.\nThe eye never has enough of seeing,\n    nor the ear its fill of hearing.",
      "9": "What has been will be again,\n    what has been done will be done again;\n    there is nothing new under the sun.",
      "10": "Is there anything of which one can say,\n    “Look! This is something new”?\nIt was here already, long ago;\n    it was here before our time.",
      "11": "No one remembers the former generations,\n    and even those yet to come\nwill not be remembered\n    by those who follow them.",
      "12": "I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
      "13": "I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind!",
      "14": "I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.",
      "15": "What is crooked cannot be straightened;\n    what is lacking cannot be counted.",
      "16": "I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.”",
      "17": "Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.",

      "14": "The wise have eyes in their heads,\n    while the fool walks in the darkness;\nbut I came to realize\n    that the same fate overtakes them both.",

      "19": "And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.",
      "20": "So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.",
      "21": "For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.",
      "22": "What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun?",
      "23": "All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.",
      "24": "A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,",

      "26": "To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."

      "21": "Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?”",
