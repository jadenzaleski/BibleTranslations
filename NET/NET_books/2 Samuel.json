      "1": "After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, he stayed at Ziklag for two days.",
      "2": "On the third day a man arrived from the camp of Saul with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. When he approached David, the man threw himself to the ground.",
      "3": "David asked him, “Where are you coming from?” He replied, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”",
      "4": "David inquired, “How were things going? Tell me!” He replied, “The people fled from the battle and many of them fell dead. Even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead!”",
      "5": "David said to the young man who was telling him this, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”",
      "6": "The young man said, “I just happened to be on Mount Gilboa and came across Saul leaning on his spear for support. The chariots and leaders of the horsemen were in hot pursuit of him.",
      "7": "When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me. I answered, ‘Here I am!’",
      "8": "He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I told him, ‘I’m an Amalekite.’",
      "9": "He said to me, ‘Stand over me and finish me off! I’m very dizzy, even though I’m still alive.’",
      "10": "So I stood over him and put him to death, since I knew that he couldn’t live in such a condition. Then I took the crown which was on his head and the bracelet which was on his arm. I have brought them here to my lord.”",
      "11": "David then grabbed his own clothes and tore them, as did all the men who were with him.",
      "12": "They lamented and wept and fasted until evening because Saul, his son Jonathan, the Lord’s army, and the house of Israel had fallen by the sword.",
      "13": "David said to the young man who told this to him, “Where are you from?” He replied, “I am an Amalekite, the son of a resident foreigner.”",
      "14": "David replied to him, “How is it that you were not afraid to reach out your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?”",
      "15": "Then David called one of the soldiers and said, “Come here and strike him down!” So he struck him down, and he died.",
      "16": "David said to him, “Your blood be on your own head! Your own mouth has testified against you, saying ‘I have put the Lord’s anointed to death.’”",
      "17": "Then David chanted this lament over Saul and his son Jonathan.",
      "18": "(He gave instructions that the people of Judah should be taught “The Bow.” Indeed, it is written down in the Scroll of the Upright One.)",

      "24": "O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,\nwho clothed you in scarlet as well as jewelry,\nwho put gold jewelry on your clothes.",
      "25": "How the warriors have fallen\nin the midst of battle!\nJonathan lies slain on your high places!",
      "26": "I grieve over you, my brother Jonathan.\nYou were very dear to me.\nYour love was more special to me than the love of women.",

      "2": "So David went up, along with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail, formerly the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.",
      "3": "David also brought along the men who were with him, each with his family. They settled in the cities of Hebron.",
      "4": "The men of Judah came and there they anointed David as king over the people of Judah.\nDavid was told, “The people of Jabesh Gilead are the ones who buried Saul.”",
      "5": "So David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh Gilead and told them, “May you be blessed by the Lord because you have shown this kindness to your lord Saul by burying him.",
      "6": "Now may the Lord show you true kindness! I also will reward you, because you have done this deed.",
      "7": "Now be courageous and prove to be valiant warriors, for your lord Saul is dead. The people of Judah have anointed me as king over them.”",

      "9": "He appointed him king over Gilead, the Geshurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all Israel.",
      "10": "Ish Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he began to rule over Israel. He ruled two years. However, the people of Judah followed David.",
      "11": "David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah for seven-and-a-half years.",
      "12": "Then Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish Bosheth son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.",
      "13": "Joab son of Zeruiah and the servants of David also went out and confronted them at the pool of Gibeon. One group stationed themselves on one side of the pool, and the other group on the other side of the pool.",
      "14": "Abner said to Joab, “Let the soldiers get up and fight before us.” Joab said, “So be it!”",
      "15": "So they got up and crossed over by number: twelve belonging to Benjamin and to Ish Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.",
      "16": "As they grappled with one another, each one stabbed his opponent with his sword and they fell dead together. So that place is called the Field of Flints; it is in Gibeon.",
      "17": "Now the battle was very severe that day; Abner and the men of Israel were overcome by David’s soldiers.",
      "18": "The three sons of Zeruiah were there—Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. (Now Asahel was as quick on his feet as one of the gazelles in the field.)",
      "19": "Asahel chased Abner, without turning to the right or to the left as he followed Abner.",
      "20": "Then Abner turned and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?” He replied, “Yes it is!”",
      "21": "Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right or to your left. Capture one of the soldiers and take his equipment for yourself!” But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from following him.",
      "22": "So Abner spoke again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me! I do not want to strike you to the ground. How then could I show my face in the presence of Joab your brother?”",
      "23": "But Asahel refused to turn aside. So Abner struck him in the abdomen with the back end of his spear. The spear came out his back; Asahel collapsed on the spot and died there right before Abner. Everyone who came to the place where Asahel fell dead paused in respect.",
      "24": "So Joab and Abishai chased Abner. At sunset they came to the hill of Ammah near Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.",
      "25": "The Benjaminites formed their ranks behind Abner and were like a single army, standing at the top of a certain hill.",
      "26": "Then Abner called out to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize that this will turn bitter in the end? When will you tell the people to turn aside from pursuing their brothers?”",
      "27": "Joab replied, “As surely as God lives, if you had not said this, it would have been morning before the people would have abandoned pursuit of their brothers.”",
      "28": "Then Joab blew the ram’s horn and all the people stopped in their tracks. They stopped chasing Israel and ceased fighting.",
      "29": "Abner and his men went through the rift valley all that night. They crossed the Jordan River and went through the whole region of Bitron and came to Mahanaim.",
      "30": "Now Joab returned from chasing Abner and assembled all the people. Nineteen of David’s soldiers were missing, in addition to Asahel.",
      "31": "But David’s soldiers had slaughtered the Benjaminites and Abner’s men—in all, 360 men had died!",
      "32": "They took Asahel’s body and buried him in his father’s tomb at Bethlehem. Joab and his men then traveled all that night and reached Hebron by dawn."

      "3": "His second son was Kileab, born to Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. His third son was Absalom, the son of Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur.",

      "5": "His sixth son was Ithream, born to David’s wife Eglah. These sons were all born to David in Hebron.",
      "6": "As the war continued between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was becoming more influential in the house of Saul.",
      "7": "Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. Ish Bosheth said to Abner, “Why did you sleep with my father’s concubine?”",
      "8": "These words of Ish Bosheth really angered Abner and he said, “Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah? This very day I am demonstrating loyalty to the house of Saul your father and to his relatives and his friends! I have not betrayed you into the hand of David. Yet you have accused me of sinning with this woman today!",
      "9": "God will severely judge Abner if I do not do for David exactly what the Lord has promised him,",
      "10": "namely, to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah all the way from Dan to Beer Sheba!”",
      "11": "Ish Bosheth was unable to answer Abner with even a single word because he was afraid of him.",
      "12": "Then Abner sent messengers to David saying, “To whom does the land belong? Make an agreement with me, and I will do whatever I can to cause all Israel to turn to you.”",
      "13": "So David said, “Good! I will make an agreement with you. I ask only one thing from you. You will not see my face unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal when you come to visit me.”",
      "14": "David sent messengers to Ish Bosheth son of Saul with this demand: “Give me my wife Michal whom I acquired for 100 Philistine foreskins.”",
      "15": "So Ish Bosheth took her from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.",
      "16": "Her husband went along behind her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Finally Abner said to him, “Go back!” So he returned home.",
      "17": "Abner advised the elders of Israel, “Previously you were wanting David to be your king.",
      "18": "Act now! For the Lord has said to David, ‘By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the Philistines and from all their enemies.’”",
      "19": "Then Abner spoke privately with the Benjaminites. Abner also went to Hebron to inform David privately of all that Israel and the entire house of Benjamin had agreed to.",
      "20": "When Abner, accompanied by twenty men, came to David in Hebron, David prepared a banquet for Abner and the men who were with him.",
      "21": "Abner said to David, “Let me leave so that I may go and gather all Israel to my lord the king so that they may make an agreement with you. Then you will rule over all that you desire.” So David sent Abner away, and he left in peace.",
      "22": "Now David’s soldiers and Joab were coming back from a raid, bringing a great deal of plunder with them. Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, for David had sent him away and he had left in peace.",
      "23": "When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, Joab was told: “Abner the son of Ner came to the king; he sent him away, and he left in peace!”",
      "24": "So Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner has come to you. Why would you send him away? Now he’s gone on his way!",
      "25": "You know Abner the son of Ner. Surely he came here to spy on you and to determine when you leave and when you return and to discover everything that you are doing!”",
      "26": "Then Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well of Sirah. (But David was not aware of it.)",
      "27": "When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate as if to speak privately with him. Joab then stabbed him in the abdomen and killed him, avenging the shed blood of his brother Asahel.",
      "28": "When David later heard about this, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the Lord of the shed blood of Abner son of Ner.",
      "29": "May his blood whirl over the head of Joab and the entire house of his father! May the males of Joab’s house never cease to have someone with a running sore or a skin disease or one who works at the spindle or one who falls by the sword or one who lacks food!”",
      "30": "So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel in Gibeon during the battle.",
      "31": "David instructed Joab and all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes. Put on sackcloth. Lament before Abner!” Now King David followed behind the funeral pallet.",
      "32": "So they buried Abner in Hebron. The king cried loudly over Abner’s grave, and all the people wept too.",
      "33": "The king chanted the following lament for Abner:\n“Should Abner have died like a fool?",
      "34": "Your hands were not bound,\nand your feet were not put into irons.\nYou fell the way one falls before criminals.” \nAll the people wept over him again.",
      "35": "Then all the people came and encouraged David to eat food while it was still day. But David took an oath saying, “God will punish me severely if I taste bread or anything whatsoever before the sun sets!”",
      "36": "All the people noticed this and it pleased them. In fact, everything the king did pleased all the people.",
      "37": "All the people and all Israel realized on that day that the killing of Abner son of Ner was not done at the king’s instigation.",
      "38": "Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not realize that a great leader has fallen this day in Israel?",
      "39": "Today I am weak, even though I am anointed as king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too much for me to bear! May the Lord punish appropriately the one who has done this evil thing!”"

      "1": "When Ish Bosheth the son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he was very disheartened, and all Israel was afraid.",
      "2": "Now Saul’s son had two men who were in charge of raiding units; one was named Baanah and the other Recab. They were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, who was a Benjaminite. (Beeroth is regarded as belonging to Benjamin,",
      "3": "for the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have remained there as resident foreigners until the present time.)",
      "4": "Now Saul’s son Jonathan had a son who was crippled in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan arrived from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but in her haste to get away, he fell and was injured. Mephibosheth was his name.",
      "5": "Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite—Recab and Baanah—went at the hottest part of the day to the home of Ish Bosheth, as he was enjoying his midday rest.",
      "6": "They entered the house under the pretense of getting wheat and mortally wounded him in the stomach. Then Recab and his brother Baanah escaped.",
      "7": "They had entered the house while Ish Bosheth was resting on his bed in his bedroom. They mortally wounded him and then cut off his head. Taking his head, they traveled on the way of the rift valley all that night.",
      "8": "They brought the head of Ish Bosheth to David in Hebron, saying to the king, “Look! The head of Ish Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life! The Lord has granted vengeance to my lord the king this day against Saul and his descendants!”",
      "9": "David replied to Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as the Lord lives, who has delivered my life from all adversity,",
      "10": "when someone told me that Saul was dead—even though he thought he was bringing good news—I seized him and killed him in Ziklag. That was the good news I gave to him!",
      "11": "Surely when wicked men have killed an innocent man as he slept in his own house, should I not now require his blood from your hands and remove you from the earth?”",
      "12": "So David issued orders to the soldiers and they put them to death. Then they cut off their hands and feet and hung them near the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish Bosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron."

      "2": "In the past, when Saul was our king, you were the real leader in Israel. The Lord said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel; you will rule over Israel.’”",
      "3": "When all the leaders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, King David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the Lord. They designated David as king over Israel.",
      "4": "David was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned for forty years.",
      "5": "In Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.",
      "6": "Then the king and his men advanced to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who lived in the land. The Jebusites said to David, “You cannot invade this place! Even the blind and the lame will turn you back, saying, ‘David cannot invade this place!’”",
      "7": "But David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David).",
      "8": "David said on that day, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites must approach the ‘lame’ and the ‘blind’ who are David’s enemies by going through the water tunnel.” For this reason it is said, “The blind and the lame cannot enter the palace.”",
      "9": "So David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David. David built all around it, from the terrace inwards.",
      "10": "David’s power grew steadily, for the Lord God of Heaven’s Armies was with him.",
      "11": "King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons. They built a palace for David.",
      "12": "David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and that he had elevated his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.",
      "13": "David married more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he arrived from Hebron. Even more sons and daughters were born to David.",

      "20": "So David marched against Baal Perazim and defeated them there. Then he said, “The Lord has burst out against my enemies like water bursts out.” So he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.",

      "22": "The Philistines again came up and spread out in the valley of Rephaim.",

      "24": "When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the trees, act decisively. For at that moment the Lord is going before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.”",

      "14": "Certainly we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground that cannot be gathered up again. But God does not take away life; instead he devises ways for the banished to be restored.",
      "15": "I have now come to speak with my lord the king about this matter, because the people have made me fearful. But your servant said, ‘I will speak to the king! Perhaps the king will do what his female servant asks.",
      "16": "Yes! The king may listen and deliver his female servant from the hand of the man who seeks to remove both me and my son from the inheritance God has given us!’",
      "17": "So your servant said, ‘May the word of my lord the king be my security, for my lord the king is like the angel of God when it comes to deciding between right and wrong! May the Lord your God be with you!’”",
      "18": "Then the king replied to the woman, “Don’t hide any information from me when I question you.” The woman said, “Let my lord the king speak.”",
      "19": "The king said, “Did Joab put you up to all of this?” The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, there is no deviation to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king has said. For your servant Joab gave me instructions. He has put all these words in your servant’s mouth.",
      "20": "Your servant Joab did this so as to change this situation. But my lord has wisdom like that of the angel of God, and knows everything that is happening in the land.”",
      "21": "Then the king said to Joab, “All right! I will do this thing. Go and bring back the young man Absalom!”",
      "22": "Then Joab bowed down with his face toward the ground and thanked the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, because the king has granted the request of your servant!”",
      "23": "So Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.",
      "24": "But the king said, “Let him go over to his own house. He may not see my face.” So Absalom went over to his own house; he did not see the king’s face.",
      "25": "Now in all Israel everyone acknowledged that there was no man as handsome as Absalom. From the soles of his feet to the top of his head he was perfect in appearance.",
      "26": "When he would shave his head—at the end of every year he used to shave his head, for it grew too long and he would shave it—he used to weigh the hair of his head at three pounds according to the king’s weight.",
      "27": "Absalom had three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a very attractive woman.",
      "28": "Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing the king’s face.",
      "29": "Then Absalom sent a message to Joab asking him to send him to the king, but Joab was not willing to come to him. So he sent a second message to him, but he still was not willing to come.",
      "30": "So he said to his servants, “Look, Joab has a portion of field adjacent to mine and he has some barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set Joab’s portion of the field on fire.",
      "31": "Then Joab got up and came to Absalom’s house. He said to him, “Why did your servants set my portion of field on fire?”",
      "32": "Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I sent a message to you saying, ‘Come here so that I can send you to the king with this message: “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there.”’ Let me now see the face of the king. If I am at fault, let him put me to death!”",
      "33": "So Joab went to the king and informed him. The king summoned Absalom, and he came to the king. Absalom bowed down before the king with his face toward the ground and the king kissed him."

      "1": "Some time later Absalom managed to acquire a chariot and horses, as well as fifty men to serve as his royal guard.",
      "2": "Now Absalom used to get up early and stand beside the road that led to the city gate. Whenever anyone came by who had a complaint to bring to the king for arbitration, Absalom would call out to him, “What city are you from?” The person would answer, “I, your servant, am from one of the tribes of Israel.”",
      "3": "Absalom would then say to him, “Look, your claims are legitimate and appropriate. But there is no representative of the king who will listen to you.”",
      "4": "Absalom would then say, “If only they would make me a judge in the land! Then everyone who had a judicial complaint could come to me and I would make sure he receives a just settlement.”",
      "5": "When someone approached to bow before him, Absalom would extend his hand and embrace him and kiss him.",
      "6": "Absalom acted this way toward everyone in Israel who came to the king for justice. In this way Absalom won the loyalty of the citizens of Israel.",
      "7": "After four years Absalom said to the king, “Let me go and repay my vow that I made to the Lord while I was in Hebron.",
      "8": "For I made this vow when I was living in Geshur in Aram: ‘If the Lord really does allow me to return to Jerusalem, I will serve the Lord.’”",
      "9": "The king replied to him, “Go in peace.” So Absalom got up and went to Hebron.",
      "10": "Then Absalom sent spies through all the tribes of Israel who said, “When you hear the sound of the horn, you may assume that Absalom rules in Hebron.”",
      "11": "Now 200 men had gone with Absalom from Jerusalem. Since they were invited, they went naively and were unaware of what Absalom was planning.",
      "12": "While he was offering sacrifices, Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s adviser, to come from his city, Giloh. The conspiracy was gaining momentum, and the people were starting to side with Absalom.",
      "13": "Then a messenger came to David and reported, “The men of Israel are loyal to Absalom!”",
      "14": "So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, “Come on! Let’s escape! Otherwise no one will be delivered from Absalom! Go immediately, or else he will quickly overtake us and bring disaster on us and kill the city’s residents with the sword.”",
      "15": "The king’s servants replied to the king, “We will do whatever our lord the king decides.”",

      "17": "The king and all the people set out on foot, pausing at a spot some distance away.",
      "18": "All his servants were leaving with him, along with all the Kerethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites—some 600 men who had come on foot from Gath. They were leaving with the king.",
      "19": "Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you come with us? Go back and stay with the new king, for you are a foreigner and an exile from your own country.",
      "20": "It seems as if you arrived just yesterday. Today should I make you wander around by going with us? I go where I must go. But as for you, go back and take your men with you. May genuine loyal love protect you!”",
      "21": "But Ittai replied to the king, “As surely as the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king is, whether it means death or life, there I will be as well!”",
      "22": "So David said to Ittai, “Come along then.” So Ittai the Gittite went along, accompanied by all his men and all the dependents who were with him.",
      "23": "All the land was weeping loudly as all these people were leaving. As the king was crossing over the Kidron Valley, all the people were leaving on the road that leads to the desert.",
      "24": "Zadok and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. When they positioned the ark of God, Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city.",
      "25": "Then the king said to Zadok, “Take the ark of God back to the city. If I find favor in the Lord’s sight he will bring me back and enable me to see both it and his dwelling place again.",
      "26": "However, if he should say, ‘I do not take pleasure in you,’ then he will deal with me in a way that he considers appropriate.”",
      "27": "The king said to Zadok the priest, “Are you a seer? Go back to the city in peace! Your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan may go with you and Abiathar.",
      "28": "Look, I will be waiting at the fords of the desert until word from you reaches me.”",
      "29": "So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and remained there.",
      "30": "As David was going up the Mount of Olives, he was weeping as he went; his head was covered and his feet were bare. All the people who were with him also had their heads covered and were weeping as they went up.",
      "31": "Now David had been told, “Ahithophel has sided with the conspirators who are with Absalom.” So David prayed, “Make the advice of Ahithophel foolish, O Lord.”",
      "32": "When David reached the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite met him with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.",
      "33": "David said to him, “If you leave with me you will be a burden to me.",
      "34": "But you will be able to counter the advice of Ahithophel if you go back to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king! Previously I was your father’s servant, and now I will be your servant.’",
      "35": "Zadok and Abiathar the priests will be there with you. Everything you hear in the king’s palace you must tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests.",

      "2": "The king asked Ziba, “Why did you bring these things?” Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s family to ride on, the loaves of bread and the summer fruit are for the attendants to eat, and the wine is for those who get exhausted in the desert.”",

      "11": "Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “My own son, my very own flesh and blood, is trying to take my life. So also now this Benjaminite! Leave him alone so that he can curse, for the Lord has spoken to him.",
      "12": "Perhaps the Lord will notice my affliction and this day grant me good in place of his curse.”",
      "13": "So David and his men went on their way. But Shimei kept going along the side of the hill opposite him, yelling curses as he threw stones and dirt at them.",
      "14": "The king and all the people who were with him arrived exhausted at their destination, where David refreshed himself.",

      "17": "Absalom said to Hushai, “Do you call this loyalty to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?”",
      "18": "Hushai replied to Absalom, “No, I will be loyal to the one whom the Lord, these people, and all the men of Israel have chosen.",
      "19": "Moreover, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.”",
      "20": "Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give us your advice. What should we do?”",
      "21": "Ahithophel replied to Absalom, “Sleep with your father’s concubines whom he left to care for the palace. All Israel will hear that you have made yourself repulsive to your father. Then your followers will be motivated to support you.”",
      "22": "So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.",

      "10": "If that happens even the bravest soldier—one who is lion-hearted—will virtually melt away. For all Israel knows that your father is a warrior and that those who are with him are brave.",
      "11": "My advice therefore is this: Let all Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba—in number like the sand by the sea—be mustered to you, and you lead them personally into battle.",

      "14": "Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite sounds better than the advice of Ahithophel.” Now the Lord had decided to frustrate the sound advice of Ahithophel, so that the Lord could bring disaster on Absalom.",

      "18": "But a young man saw them on one occasion and informed Absalom. So the two of them quickly departed and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. There was a well in his courtyard, and they got down in it.",
      "19": "His wife then took the covering and spread it over the top of the well and scattered some grain over it. No one was aware of what she had done.",
      "20": "When the servants of Absalom approached the woman at her home, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” The woman replied to them, “They crossed over the stream.” Absalom’s men searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.",

      "23": "When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and returned to his house in his hometown. After setting his household in order, he hanged himself. So he died and was buried in the grave of his father.",

      "15": "So the Lord sent a plague through Israel from the morning until the completion of the appointed time, and 70,000 people died from Dan to Beer Sheba.",
      "16": "When the angel extended his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the Lord relented from his judgment. He told the angel who was killing the people, “That’s enough! Stop now!” (Now the angel of the Lord was near the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.)",
      "17": "When he saw the angel who was destroying the people, David said to the Lord, “Look, it is I who have sinned and done this evil thing! As for these sheep—what have they done? Attack me and my family.”",
      "18": "So Gad went to David that day and told him, “Go up and build an altar for the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”",
      "19": "So David went up as Gad instructed him to do, according to the Lord’s instructions.",
      "20": "When Araunah looked out and saw the king and his servants approaching him, he went out and bowed to the king with his face to the ground.",
      "21": "Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David replied, “To buy from you the threshing floor so I can build an altar for the Lord, so that the plague may be removed from the people.”",
      "22": "Araunah told David, “My lord the king may take whatever he wishes and offer it. Look! Here are oxen for burnt offerings, and threshing sledges and harnesses for wood.",
      "23": "I, the servant of my lord the king, give it all to the king!” Araunah also told the king, “May the Lord your God show you favor!”",
      "24": "But the king said to Araunah, “No, I insist on buying it from you! I will not offer to the Lord my God burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.”\nSo David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty pieces of silver.",
      "25": "Then David built an altar for the Lord there and offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings. And the Lord accepted prayers for the land, and the plague was removed from Israel."
