      "47": "Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘The daughter of Bethuel the son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to Nahor.’ I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her wrists.",
      "48": "Then I bowed down and worshiped the Lord. I praised the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right path to find the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son.",

      "6": "“Is he well?” Jacob asked. They replied, “He is well. Now look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”",
      "7": "Then Jacob said, “Since it is still the middle of the day, it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. You should water the sheep and then go and let them graze some more.”",
      "8": "“We can’t,” they said, “until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled off the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep.”",
      "9": "While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep, for she was tending them.",

      "27": "Complete my older daughter’s bridal week. Then we will give you the younger one too, in exchange for seven more years of work.”",

      "33": "My integrity will testify for me later on. When you come to verify that I’ve taken only the wages we agreed on, if I have in my possession any goat that is not speckled or spotted or any sheep that is not dark-colored, it will be considered stolen.”",
      "34": "“Agreed!” said Laban, “It will be as you say.”",
      "35": "So that day Laban removed the male goats that were streaked or spotted, all the female goats that were speckled or spotted (all that had any white on them), and all the dark-colored lambs, and put them in the care of his sons.",

      "39": "When the sheep mated in front of the branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.",
      "40": "Jacob removed these lambs, but he made the rest of the flock face the streaked and completely dark-colored animals in Laban’s flock. So he made separate flocks for himself and did not mix them with Laban’s flocks.",
      "41": "When the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would set up the branches in the troughs in front of the flock, so they would mate near the branches.",
      "42": "But if the animals were weaker, he did not set the branches there. So the weaker animals ended up belonging to Laban and the stronger animals to Jacob.",

      "15": "Hasn’t he treated us like foreigners? He not only sold us, but completely wasted the money paid for us!",
      "16": "Surely all the wealth that God snatched away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So now do everything God has told you.”",
      "17": "So Jacob immediately put his children and his wives on the camels.",

      "27": "Why did you run away secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me so I could send you off with a celebration complete with singing, tambourines, and harps?",
      "28": "You didn’t even allow me to kiss my daughters and my grandchildren goodbye. You have acted foolishly!",
      "29": "I have the power to do you harm, but the God of your father told me last night, ‘Be careful that you neither bless nor curse Jacob.’",
      "30": "Now I understand that you have gone away because you longed desperately for your father’s house. Yet why did you steal my gods?”",
      "31": "“I left secretly because I was afraid!” Jacob replied to Laban. “I thought you might take your daughters away from me by force.",
      "32": "Whoever has taken your gods will be put to death! In the presence of our relatives identify whatever is yours and take it.” (Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.)",
      "33": "So Laban entered Jacob’s tent, and Leah’s tent, and the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find the idols. Then he left Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s.",

      "37": "When you searched through all my goods, did you find anything that belonged to you? Set it here before my relatives and yours, and let them settle the dispute between the two of us!",

      "41": "This was my lot for twenty years in your house: I worked like a slave for you—fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks—but you changed my wages ten times!",
      "42": "If the God of my father—the God of Abraham, the one whom Isaac fears—had not been with me, you would certainly have sent me away empty-handed! But God saw how I was oppressed and how hard I worked, and he rebuked you last night.”",
      "43": "Laban replied to Jacob, “These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks. All that you see belongs to me. But how can I harm these daughters of mine today or the children to whom they have given birth?",
      "44": "So now, come, let’s make a formal agreement, you and I, and it will be proof that we have made peace.”",
      "45": "So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial pillar.",
