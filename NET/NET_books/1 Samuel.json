  "1 Samuel": {
    "1": {
      "1": "There was a man from Ramathaim Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim. His name was Elkanah. He was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.",
      "2": "He had two wives; the name of the first was Hannah and the name of the second was Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.",
      "3": "This man would go up from his city year after year to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of Heaven’s Armies at Shiloh. (It was there that the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, served as the Lord’s priests.)",
      "4": "The day came, and Elkanah sacrificed.\n(Now he used to give meat portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.",
      "5": "But to Hannah he would give a double portion because he loved Hannah, although the Lord had not enabled her to have children.",
      "6": "Her rival used to aggravate her to the point of exasperation, just to irritate her, since the Lord had not enabled her to have children.",
      "7": "This is how it would go year after year. As often as she went up to the Lord’s house, Peninnah would offend her in that way.)\nSo she cried and refused to eat.",
      "8": "Then her husband Elkanah said to her, “Hannah, why are you crying and why won’t you eat? Why are you so upset? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "So Hannah got up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh.\nAt the time Eli the priest was sitting in his chair by the doorpost of the Lord’s sanctuary.",
      "10": "As for Hannah, she was very distressed. She prayed to the Lord and was, in fact, weeping.",
      "11": "She made a vow saying, “O Lord of Heaven’s Armies, if you would truly look on the suffering of your servant, and would keep me in mind and not neglect your servant, and give your servant a male child, then I will dedicate him to the Lord all the days of his life. His hair will never be cut.”",
      "12": "It turned out that she did a great deal of praying before the Lord. Meanwhile Eli was watching her mouth.",
      "13": "As for Hannah, she was speaking in her mind. Only her lips were moving; her voice could not be heard. So Eli thought she was a drunkard.",
      "14": "Then he said to her, “How much longer do you intend to get drunk? Put away your wine!”",
      "15": "But Hannah replied, “Not so, my lord! I am a woman under a great deal of stress. I haven’t drunk wine or beer. But I have poured out my soul before the Lord.",
      "16": "Don’t consider your servant a wicked woman. It’s just that, to this point, I have spoken from my deep pain and anguish.”",
      "17": "Eli replied, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant the request that you have asked of him.”",
      "18": "She said, “May I, your servant, find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and got something to eat. Her face no longer looked sad.",
      "19": "They got up early the next morning. Then they worshiped the Lord and returned to their home at Ramathaim. Elkanah was intimate with his wife Hannah, and the Lord called her to mind.",
      "20": "Then Hannah became pregnant.\nIn the course of time she gave birth to a son. And she named him Samuel, thinking, “I asked the Lord for him.”",
      "21": "Then the man Elkanah and all his family went up to make the yearly sacrifice to the Lord and to keep his vow.",
      "22": "But Hannah did not go up with them, because she had told her husband, “Not until the boy is weaned. Then I will bring him so that he may appear before the Lord. And he will remain there from then on.”",
      "23": "Then her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what you think best. Stay until you have weaned him. Only may the Lord fulfill his promise.”\nSo the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.",
      "24": "Then she took him up with her as soon as she had weaned him, along with three bulls, an ephah of flour, and a container of wine. She came to the Lord’s house at Shiloh, and the boy was with them.",
      "25": "They slaughtered the bull, then brought the boy to Eli.",
      "26": "She said, “My lord. Just as surely as you are alive, my lord, I am the woman who previously stood here with you in order to pray to the Lord.",
      "27": "For this boy I prayed, and the Lord has given me the request that I asked of him.",
      "28": "So I also dedicate him to the Lord. For all the days of his life he is dedicated to the Lord.” Then he bowed down there in worship to the Lord."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Hannah prayed,\n“My heart has rejoiced in the Lord;\nmy horn has been raised high because of the Lord.\nI have loudly denounced my enemies.\nIndeed I rejoice in your deliverance.",
      "2": "No one is holy like the Lord!\nThere is no one other than you!\nThere is no rock like our God!",
      "3": "Don’t keep speaking so arrogantly.\nProud talk should not come out of your mouth,\nfor the Lord is a God who knows;\nhe evaluates what people do.",
      "4": "The bows of warriors are shattered,\nbut those who stumbled have taken on strength.",
      "5": "The well fed hire themselves out to earn food,\nbut the hungry no longer lack.\nEven the barren woman has given birth to seven,\nbut the one with many children has declined.",
      "6": "The Lord both kills and gives life;\nhe brings down to the grave and raises up.",
      "7": "The Lord impoverishes and makes wealthy;\nhe humbles and he exalts.",
      "8": "He lifts the weak from the dust;\nhe raises the poor from the ash heap\nto seat them with princes—\nhe bestows on them an honored position.\nThe foundations of the earth belong to the Lord—\nhe placed the world on them.",
      "9": "He watches over his holy ones,\nbut the wicked are made speechless in the darkness,\nfor it is not by one’s own strength that one prevails.",
      "10": "The Lord shatters his adversaries;\nhe thunders against them from the heavens.\nThe Lord executes judgment to the ends of the earth.\nHe will strengthen his king\nand exalt the power of his anointed one.”",
      "11": "Then Elkanah went back home to Ramah.\nThe boy Samuel was serving the Lord with the favor of Eli the priest.",
      "12": "But the sons of Eli were wicked men. They did not acknowledge the Lord’s authority.",
      "13": "This was the priests’ routine with the people. Whenever anyone was making a sacrifice, the priest’s attendant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand, just as the meat was boiling.",
      "14": "He would jab it into the basin, kettle, cauldron, or pot. Everything that the fork would bring up the priest would take for himself. This is how they used to treat all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.",
      "15": "Also, before they burned the fat the priest’s attendant would come and say to the person who was making the sacrifice, “Give some meat for the priest to roast! He won’t accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”",
      "16": "If the individual said to him, “They should certainly burn the fat away first, then take for yourself whatever you wish,” then he would say, “No! Give it now! If not, I’ll take it by force!”",
      "17": "The sin of these young men was very great in the Lord’s sight, for they treated the Lord’s offering with contempt.",
      "18": "Now Samuel was ministering with the favor of the Lord. The boy was dressed in a linen ephod.",
      "19": "His mother used to make him a small robe and bring it to him from time to time when she would go up with her husband to make the annual sacrifice.",
      "20": "Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife saying, “May the Lord establish descendants for you from this woman in place of the one that she dedicated to the Lord.” Then they would go to their home.",
      "21": "And indeed the Lord attended to Hannah. She got pregnant and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. But the boy Samuel grew up before the Lord.",
      "22": "Eli was very old. And he would hear about everything that his sons used to do to all the people of Israel and how they used to go to bed with the women who were stationed at the entrance to the tent of meeting.",
      "23": "So he said to them, “Why do you do these things, these evil things that I hear about from all these people?",
      "24": "No, my sons! For the report that I hear circulating among the Lord’s people is not good.",
      "25": "If a man sins against a man, one may appeal to God on his behalf. But if a man sins against the Lord, who can intercede for him?” But Eli’s sons would not listen to their father. Indeed the Lord had decided to kill them.",
      "26": "However, the boy Samuel was growing up and finding favor both with the Lord and with people.",
      "27": "Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lord has said: ‘I plainly revealed myself to your ancestor’s house when they were slaves to the house of Pharaoh in Egypt.",
      "28": "I chose your ancestor from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer sacrifice on my altar, to burn incense, and to bear the ephod before me. I gave to your ancestor’s house all the fire offerings made by the Israelites.",
      "29": "Why are you scorning my sacrifice and my offering that I commanded for my dwelling place? You have honored your sons more than you have me by having made yourselves fat from the best parts of all the offerings of my people Israel.’",
      "30": "“Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, says, ‘I really did say that your house and your ancestor’s house would serve me forever.’ But now the Lord says, ‘May it never be! For I will honor those who honor me, but those who despise me will be cursed!",
      "31": "In fact, days are coming when I will remove your strength and the strength of your father’s house. There will not be an old man in your house!",
      "32": "You will see trouble in my dwelling place! Israel will experience blessings, but there will not be an old man in your house for all time.",
      "33": "Any man of yours that I do not cut off from my altar, I will cause his eyes to fail and will cause him grief. All those born to your family will die by the sword of man.",
      "34": "This will be a confirming sign for you that will be fulfilled through your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: in a single day they both will die!",
      "35": "Then I will raise up for myself a faithful priest. He will do what is in my heart and soul. I will build for him a lasting dynasty, and he will serve my chosen one for all time.",
      "36": "Everyone who remains in your house will come to bow before him for a little money and for a scrap of bread. Each will say, “Assign me to a priestly task so I can eat a scrap of bread.”’”"
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Now the boy Samuel continued serving the Lord under Eli’s supervision. Receiving a message from the Lord was rare in those days; revelatory visions were infrequent.",
      "2": "Eli’s eyes had begun to fail, so that he was unable to see well. At that time he was lying down in his place,",
      "3": "and the lamp of God had not yet been extinguished. Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord as well; the ark of God was also there.",
      "4": "The Lord called to Samuel, and he replied, “Here I am!”",
      "5": "Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli said, “I didn’t call you. Go back and lie down.” So he went back and lay down.",
      "6": "The Lord again called, “Samuel!” So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli said, “I didn’t call you, my son. Go back and lie down.”",
      "7": "Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord; the Lord’s messages had not yet been revealed to him.",
      "8": "Then the Lord called Samuel a third time. So he got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me!” Eli then realized that it was the Lord who was calling the boy.",
      "9": "So Eli said to Samuel, “Go back and lie down. When he calls you, say, ‘Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.’ So Samuel went back and lay down in his place.",
      "10": "Then the Lord came and stood nearby, calling as he had previously done, “Samuel! Samuel!” Samuel replied, “Speak, for your servant is listening!”",
      "11": "The Lord said to Samuel, “Look! I am about to do something in Israel; when anyone hears about it, both of his ears will tingle.",
      "12": "On that day I will carry out against Eli everything that I spoke about his house—from start to finish!",
      "13": "You should tell him that I am about to judge his house forever because of the sin that he knew about. For his sons were cursing God, and he did not rebuke them.",
      "14": "Therefore I swore an oath to the house of Eli, ‘The sin of the house of Eli can never be forgiven by sacrifice or by grain offering.’”",
      "15": "So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the Lord’s house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.",
      "16": "However, Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” He replied, “Here I am.”",
      "17": "Eli said, “What message did he speak to you? Don’t conceal it from me. God will judge you severely if you conceal from me anything that he said to you!”",
      "18": "So Samuel told him everything. He did not hold back anything from him. Eli said, “The Lord will do what he pleases.”",
      "19": "Samuel continued to grow, and the Lord was with him. None of his prophecies fell to the ground unfulfilled.",
      "20": "All Israel from Dan to Beer Sheba realized that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the Lord.",
      "21": "Then the Lord again appeared in Shiloh, for it was in Shiloh that the Lord had revealed himself to Samuel through a message from the Lord."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Samuel revealed the word of the Lord to all Israel.\nThen the Israelites went out to fight the Philistines. They camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines camped at Aphek.",
      "2": "The Philistines arranged their forces to fight Israel. As the battle spread out, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about 4,000 men in the battle line in the field.",
      "3": "When the army came back to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why did the Lord let us be defeated today by the Philistines? Let’s take with us the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Shiloh. When it is with us, it will save us from the hand of our enemies.”",
      "4": "So the army sent to Shiloh, and they took from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, who sits between the cherubim. Now the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.",
      "5": "When the ark of the covenant of the Lord arrived at the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly that the ground shook.",
      "6": "When the Philistines heard the sound of the shout, they said, “What is this loud shout in the camp of the Hebrews?” Then they realized that the ark of the Lord had arrived at the camp.",
      "7": "The Philistines were scared because they thought that gods had come to the camp. They said, “Woe to us! We’ve never seen anything like this!",
      "8": "Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all sorts of plagues in the desert!",
      "9": "Be strong and act like men, you Philistines, or else you will wind up serving the Hebrews the way they have served you! Act like men and fight!”",
      "10": "So the Philistines fought. Israel was defeated; they all ran home. The slaughter was very great; 30,000 foot soldiers from Israel fell in battle.",
      "11": "The ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were killed.",
      "12": "On that day a Benjaminite ran from the battle lines and came to Shiloh. His clothes were torn, and dirt was on his head.",
      "13": "When he arrived in Shiloh, Eli was sitting in his chair on the lookout by the side of the road, for he was very worried about the ark of God. As the man entered the city to give his report, the whole city cried out.",
      "14": "When Eli heard the outcry, he said, “What’s this commotion?” The man quickly came and told Eli.",
      "15": "Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes looked straight ahead; he was unable to see.",
      "16": "The man said to Eli, “I am the one who came from the battle lines! Just today I fled from the battle lines!” Eli asked, “How did things go, my son?”",
      "17": "The messenger replied, “Israel has fled from the Philistines! The army has suffered a great defeat! Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead! The ark of God has been captured!”",
      "18": "When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward from his chair beside the gate. He broke his neck and died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for forty years.",
      "19": "His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and close to giving birth. When she heard that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she doubled over and gave birth. But her labor pains were too much for her.",
      "20": "As she was dying, the women who were there with her said, “Don’t be afraid! You have given birth to a son!” But she did not reply or pay any attention.",
      "21": "She named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” referring to the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.",
      "22": "She said, “The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God has been captured.”"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Now the Philistines had captured the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.",
      "2": "The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the temple of Dagon, where they positioned it beside Dagon.",
      "3": "When the residents of Ashdod got up early the next day, Dagon was lying on the ground before the ark of the Lord. So they took Dagon and set him back in his place.",
      "4": "But when they got up early the following day, Dagon was again lying on the ground before the ark of the Lord. The head of Dagon and his two hands were sheared off and were lying at the threshold. Only Dagon’s body was left intact.",
      "5": "(For this reason, to this very day, neither Dagon’s priests nor anyone else who enters Dagon’s temple steps on Dagon’s threshold in Ashdod.)",
      "6": "The Lord attacked the residents of Ashdod severely, bringing devastation on them. He struck the people of both Ashdod and the surrounding area with sores.",
      "7": "When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel should not remain with us, for he has attacked both us and our god Dagon!”",
      "8": "So they assembled all the leaders of the Philistines and asked, “What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They replied, “The ark of the God of Israel should be moved to Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.",
      "9": "But after it had been moved the Lord attacked that city as well, causing a great deal of panic. He struck all the people of that city with sores.",
      "10": "So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.\nBut when the ark of God arrived at Ekron, the residents of Ekron cried out saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel here to kill our people!”",
      "11": "So they assembled all the leaders of the Philistines and said, “Get the ark of the God of Israel out of here! Let it go back to its own place so that it won’t kill us and our people!” The terror of death was throughout the entire city; God was attacking them very severely there.",
      "12": "The people who did not die were struck with sores; the city’s cry for help went all the way up to heaven."
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "When the ark of the Lord had been in the land of the Philistines for seven months,",
      "2": "the Philistines called the priests and the omen readers, saying, “What should we do with the ark of the Lord? Advise us as to how we should send it back to its place.”",
      "3": "They replied, “If you are going to send the ark of the God of Israel back, don’t send it away empty. Be sure to return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why his hand has not been removed from you.”",
      "4": "They inquired, “What is the guilt offering that we should send to him?”\nThey replied, “The Philistine leaders number five. So send five gold sores and five gold mice, for it is the same plague that has afflicted both you and your leaders.",
      "5": "You should make images of the sores and images of the mice that are destroying the land. You should honor the God of Israel. Perhaps he will release his grip on you, your gods, and your land.",
      "6": "Why harden your hearts like the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When God treated them harshly, didn’t the Egyptians send the Israelites on their way?",
      "7": "So now go and make a new cart. Get two cows that have calves and that have never had a yoke placed on them. Harness the cows to the cart, and take their calves from them back to their stalls.",
      "8": "Then take the ark of the Lord and place it on the cart, and put in a chest beside it the gold objects you are sending to him as a guilt offering. You should then send it on its way.",
      "9": "But keep an eye on it. If it should go up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has brought this great calamity on us. But if that is not the case, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us; rather, it just happened to us by accident.”",
      "10": "So the men did as instructed. They took two cows that had calves and harnessed the cows to a cart; they also removed their calves to their stalls.",
      "11": "They put the ark of the Lord on the cart, along with the chest, the gold mice, and the images of the sores.",
      "12": "Then the cows went directly on the road to Beth Shemesh. They went along that route, bellowing more and more; they turned neither to the right nor to the left. The leaders of the Philistines were walking along behind them all the way to the border of Beth Shemesh.",
      "13": "Now the residents of Beth Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the ark, they were pleased at the sight.",
      "14": "The cart was coming to the field of Joshua, who was from Beth Shemesh. It paused there near a big stone. Then they cut up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord.",
      "15": "The Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest that was with it, which contained the gold objects. They placed them near the big stone. At that time the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord.",
      "16": "The five leaders of the Philistines watched what was happening and then returned to Ekron on the same day.",
      "17": "These are the gold sores that the Philistines brought as a guilt offering to the Lord—one for each of the following cities: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.",
      "18": "The gold mice corresponded in number to all the Philistine cities of the five leaders, from the fortified cities to hamlet villages, to greater Abel. They positioned the ark of the Lord on a rock until this very day in the field of Joshua who was from Beth Shemesh.",
      "19": "But the Lord struck down some of the people of Beth Shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the Lord; he struck down 50,070 of the men. The people grieved because the Lord had struck the people with a hard blow.",
      "20": "The residents of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who is able to stand before the Lord, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?”",
      "21": "So they sent messengers to the residents of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord. Come down here and take it back home with you.”"
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "Then the people of Kiriath Jearim came and took the ark of the Lord; they brought it to the house of Abinadab located on the hill. They consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the Lord.",
      "2": "It was quite a long time—some twenty years in all—that the ark stayed at Kiriath Jearim. All the people of Israel longed for the Lord.",
      "3": "Samuel said to all the people of Israel, “If you are really turning to the Lord with all your hearts, remove from among you the foreign gods and the images of Ashtoreth. Give your hearts to the Lord and serve only him. Then he will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”",
      "4": "So the Israelites removed the Baals and images of Ashtoreth. They served only the Lord.",
      "5": "Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the Lord on your behalf.”",
      "6": "After they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the Lord. They fasted on that day, and they confessed there, “We have sinned against the Lord.” So Samuel led the people of Israel at Mizpah.",
      "7": "When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the leaders of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the Israelites heard about this, they were afraid of the Philistines.",
      "8": "The Israelites said to Samuel, “Keep crying out to the Lord our God so that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines!”",
      "9": "So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. Samuel cried out to the Lord on Israel’s behalf, and the Lord answered him.",
      "10": "As Samuel was offering burnt offerings, the Philistines approached to do battle with Israel. But on that day the Lord thundered loudly against the Philistines. He caused them to panic, and they were defeated by Israel.",
      "11": "Then the men of Israel left Mizpah and chased the Philistines, striking them down all the way to an area below Beth Car.",
      "12": "Samuel took a stone and placed it between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Up to here the Lord has helped us.”",
      "13": "So the Philistines were defeated; they did not invade Israel again. The hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.",
      "14": "The cities that the Philistines had captured from Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekron to Gath. Israel also delivered their territory from the control of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.",
      "15": "So Samuel led Israel all the days of his life.",
      "16": "Year after year he used to travel the circuit of Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; he used to judge Israel in all these places.",
      "17": "Then he would return to Ramah, because his home was there. He also judged Israel there and built an altar to the Lord there."

    "8": {
      "1": "In his old age Samuel appointed his sons as judges over Israel.",
      "2": "The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beer Sheba.",
      "3": "But his sons did not follow his ways. Instead, they made money dishonestly, accepted bribes, and perverted justice.",
      "4": "So all the elders of Israel gathered together and approached Samuel at Ramah.",
      "5": "They said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons don’t follow your ways. So now appoint over us a king to lead us, just like all the other nations have.”",
      "6": "But this request displeased Samuel, for they said, “Give us a king to lead us.” So Samuel prayed to the Lord.",
      "7": "The Lord said to Samuel, “Do everything the people request of you. For it is not you that they have rejected, but it is me that they have rejected as their king.",
      "8": "Just as they have done from the day that I brought them up from Egypt until this very day, they have rejected me and have served other gods. This is what they are also doing to you.",
      "9": "So now do as they say. But you must warn them and make them aware of the policies of the king who will rule over them.”",

      "28": "Please forgive the sin of your servant, for the Lord will certainly establish a lasting dynasty for my lord, because my lord fights the battles of the Lord. May no evil be found in you all your days!",
      "29": "When someone sets out to chase you and to take your life, the life of my lord will be wrapped securely in the bag of the living by the Lord your God. But he will sling away the lives of your enemies from the sling’s pocket!",

      "31": "Your conscience will not be overwhelmed with guilt for having poured out innocent blood and for having taken matters into your own hands. When the Lord has granted my lord success, please remember your servant.”",

      "33": "Praised be your good judgment! May you yourself be rewarded for having prevented me this day from shedding blood and taking matters into my own hands!",
      "34": "Otherwise, as surely as the Lord, the God of Israel, lives—he who has prevented me from harming you—if you had not come so quickly to meet me, by morning’s light not even one male belonging to Nabal would have remained alive!”",
      "35": "Then David took from her hand what she had brought to him. He said to her, “Go back to your home in peace. Be assured that I have listened to you and responded favorably.”",
      "36": "When Abigail went back to Nabal, he was holding a banquet in his house like that of the king. Nabal was having a good time and was very intoxicated. She told him absolutely nothing until morning’s light.",
      "37": "In the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him about these matters. He had a stroke and was paralyzed.",
      "38": "After about ten days the Lord struck Nabal down and he died.",
      "39": "When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, “Praised be the Lord who has vindicated me and avenged the insult that I suffered from Nabal! The Lord has kept his servant from doing evil, and he has repaid Nabal for his evil deeds.” Then David sent word to Abigail and asked her to become his wife.",
      "40": "So the servants of David went to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, “David has sent us to you to bring you back to be his wife.”",
      "41": "She arose, bowed her face toward the ground, and said, “Your female servant, like a lowly servant, will wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”",
      "42": "Then Abigail quickly went and mounted her donkey, with five of her female servants accompanying her. She followed David’s messengers and became his wife.",
      "43": "David had also married Ahinoam from Jezreel; the two of them became his wives.",

      "3": "Saul camped by the road on the hill of Hakilah near Jeshimon, but David was staying in the wilderness. When he realized that Saul had come to the wilderness to find him,",
      "4": "David sent scouts and verified that Saul had indeed arrived.",
      "5": "So David set out and went to the place where Saul was camped. David saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general in command of his army, were sleeping. Now Saul was lying in the entrenchment, and the army was camped all around him.",
      "6": "David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” Abishai replied, “I will go down with you.”",
      "7": "So David and Abishai approached the army at night and found Saul lying asleep in the entrenchment with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. Abner and the army were lying all around him.",
      "8": "Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me drive the spear right through him into the ground with one swift jab! A second jab won’t be necessary!”",
      "9": "But David said to Abishai, “Don’t kill him! Who can extend his hand against the Lord’s chosen one and remain guiltless?”",
      "10": "David went on to say, “As the Lord lives, the Lord himself will strike him down. Either his day will come and he will die, or he will go down into battle and be swept away.",
      "11": "But may the Lord prevent me from extending my hand against the Lord’s chosen one! Now take the spear by Saul’s head and the jug of water, and let’s get out of here!”",
      "12": "So David took the spear and the jug of water by Saul’s head, and they got out of there. No one saw them or was aware of their presence or woke up. All of them were asleep, for the Lord had caused a deep sleep to fall on them.",
      "13": "Then David crossed to the other side and stood on the top of the hill some distance away; there was a considerable distance between them.",
      "14": "David called to the army and to Abner son of Ner, “Won’t you answer, Abner?” Abner replied, “Who are you, that you have called to the king?”",
      "15": "David said to Abner, “Aren’t you a man? After all, who is like you in Israel? Why then haven’t you protected your lord the king? One of the soldiers came to kill your lord the king.",
      "16": "This failure on your part isn’t good! As surely as the Lord lives, you people who have not protected your lord, the Lord’s chosen one, are as good as dead! Now look where the king’s spear and the jug of water that was by his head are!”",
      "17": "When Saul recognized David’s voice, he said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” David replied, “Yes, it’s my voice, my lord the king.”",
      "18": "He went on to say, “Why is my lord chasing his servant? What have I done? What wrong have I done?",
      "19": "So let my lord the king now listen to the words of his servant. If the Lord has incited you against me, may he take delight in an offering. But if men have instigated this, may they be cursed before the Lord! For they have driven me away this day from being united with the Lord’s inheritance, saying, ‘Go on, serve other gods!’",
      "20": "Now don’t let my blood fall to the ground away from the Lord’s presence, for the king of Israel has gone out to look for a flea the way one looks for a partridge in the hill country.”",
      "21": "Saul replied, “I have sinned. Come back, my son David. I won’t harm you anymore, for you treated my life with value this day. I have behaved foolishly and have made a very terrible mistake!”",
      "22": "David replied, “Here is the king’s spear! Let one of your servants cross over and get it.",
      "23": "The Lord rewards each man for his integrity and loyalty. Even though today the Lord delivered you into my hand, I was not willing to extend my hand against the Lord’s chosen one.",
      "24": "In the same way that I valued your life this day, may the Lord value my life and deliver me from all danger.”",

      "2": "So David left and crossed over to King Achish son of Maoch of Gath accompanied by his 600 men.",
      "3": "David settled with Achish in Gath, along with his men and their families. David had with him his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal’s widow.",
      "4": "When Saul learned that David had fled to Gath, he did not mount a new search for him.",
      "5": "David said to Achish, “If I have found favor with you, let me be given a place in one of the country towns so that I can live there. Why should your servant settle in the royal city with you?”",
      "6": "So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (For that reason Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this very day.)",
      "7": "The length of time that David lived in the Philistine countryside was a year and four months.",
      "8": "Then David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (They had been living in that land for a long time, from the approach to Shur as far as the land of Egypt.)",
      "9": "When David would attack a district, he would leave neither man nor woman alive. He would take sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing and would then go back to Achish.",
      "10": "When Achish would ask, “Where did you raid today?” David would say, “The Negev of Judah” or “The Negev of Jerahmeel” or “The Negev of the Kenites.”",
      "11": "Neither man nor woman would David leave alive so as to bring them back to Gath. He was thinking, “This way they can’t tell on us, saying, ‘This is what David did.’” Such was his practice the entire time that he lived in the country of the Philistines.",
      "12": "So Achish trusted David, thinking to himself, “He is really hated among his own people in Israel! From now on he will be my servant.”"

      "13": "The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid! But what have you seen?” The woman replied to Saul, “I have seen a divine being coming up from the ground!”",
      "14": "He said to her, “What about his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up! He is wrapped in a robe!”\nThen Saul realized it was Samuel, and he bowed his face toward the ground and kneeled down.",

He does not answer me anymore—not by the prophets nor by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what I should do.”",
      "16": "Samuel said, “Why are you asking me, now that the Lord has turned away from you and has become your enemy?",
      "17": "The Lord has done exactly as I prophesied! The Lord has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor David!",
      "18": "Since you did not obey the Lord and did not carry out his fierce anger against the Amalekites, the Lord has done this thing to you today.",
      "19": "The Lord will hand you and Israel over to the Philistines! Tomorrow both you and your sons will be with me. The Lord will also hand the army of Israel over to the Philistines!”",
      "20": "Saul quickly fell full length on the ground and was very afraid because of Samuel’s words. He was completely drained of energy, having not eaten anything all that day and night.",
      "21": "When the woman came to Saul and saw how terrified he was, she said to him, “Your servant has done what you asked. I took my life into my own hands and did what you told me.",
      "22": "Now it’s your turn to listen to your servant! Let me set before you a bit of bread so that you can eat. When you regain your strength, you can go on your way.”",
      "23": "But he refused, saying, “I won’t eat!” Both his servants and the woman urged him to eat, so he gave in. He got up from the ground and sat down on the bed.",
      "24": "Now the woman had a well-fed calf at her home that she quickly slaughtered. Taking some flour, she kneaded it and baked bread without leaven.",

I have found no fault with him from the day of his defection until the present time!”",
      "4": "But the leaders of the Philistines became angry with him and said to him, “Send the man back! Let him return to the place that you assigned him! Don’t let him go down with us into the battle, for he might become our adversary in the battle. What better way to please his lord than with the heads of these men?",
      "5": "Isn’t this David, of whom they sang as they danced,\n‘Saul has struck down his thousands,\nbut David his tens of thousands’?”",

I have found no fault with you from the day that you first came to me until the present time. But in the opinion of the leaders, you are not reliable.",
